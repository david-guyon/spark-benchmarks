Introduction to the Transcript
------------------------------

It has been quite a while wince the Document came out, unfortunately I was
never able to do a text dump from the disc, which would have been a great 
source of information since the complete script for the game is present in it.

But then, Leiner devoted hours to this document you now have, a full transcript
of the much awaited script for Sons Of Liberty. 

Since it is a transcript, it is prone to human error. Please cpntact me for
any corrections or additions you may have at http://junkerhq.net/about.html.

I hope you like it and find it as interesting, and a bit more practical, in 
this format. You are free to make backups of thsi document if you keep it in its 
full form and do not change the credits.

<Tanker Chapter>
     From Opening Demo
       To Kamov Discovery Demo



SCENE T00a1D Opening Demo:

Reminiscing monologue
Snake’s Monologue as he looks back on the events of two years ago.

Snake:
	The Hudson River, two years ago
Snake:
	We had classified intelligence that a new type of Metal Gear was
	scheduled for transport.
Snake:
	The whole thing stank, but our noses had been out in the cold for
	too long...

SCENE T00a2D Opening Demo
Hudson River in the storm

Telop: George Washington Bridge, Manhattan

The Hudson River roils in the storm. Snake stands on the bridge (George
Washington Bridge) in his stealth camo. Only his silhouette, outlined by
the constant shafts of water glancing off the invisible figure, can be
made out. The disguised tanker cruises into view on the river. Visibility
is close to zero due to the heavy rain, high winds and dense fog. Snake
dives off the bridge strut, he has a small parachute on his back, and his
body throughout is wired with thin filaments. The tanker’s deck looms
before him.

The miniaturized stealth parachute blossoms on Snake’s back. The wings are
automatically opened by an automatic opening device (AOD). The rain
streams off the parachute wings and draws its outline in the sky.

The tanker’s bridge crew switches to autopilot after clearing the George
Washington Bridge.

Tanker crewman:
	Haaaahhhhh...

The crewman looks out of the window. As the wiper clears away the
moisture, the lights of Manhattan materialize(to the left and ahead).
(Raindrops on the window glass). The crewman, preoccupied with the view,
does not notice Snake. The helm goes through its automated motions on the
deck.

Snake lands on the tanker’s deck, to the stern of the ship. The impact of
the landing renders the stealth camo ineffective, and Snake is forced to
deactivate the stealth function and become visible. He immediately cuts
himself loose from the parachute and attaches the wings to the filament on
his back. The diminuative parachute - - fragile as angel’s wings - - sits
on the filament as it tightens with the tanker’s forward movement; its
other end tethered to the bridge railing high above. When the wire is
fully taunt, Snake lets go of his gear; it disappears into the murky sky,
carried off by the filament. The retractor reels in the parcel
automatically and the pack comes to rest in the shelter of the bridge.

Cut to binocular (nightscope) FPV (first person view), zoom view (green).
Snake is in the center of the circular field of vision. The view is from a
helicopter above the tanker (very high altitude). A man (Ocelot) is
looking through the binoculars from inside the chopper.

Ocelot:
	Our boy is right on schedule.

Ocelot touches the revolver in his lap with his right hand.

Ocelot:
	He’ll know soon enough.

Snake ducks quickly behind the windlass. A close up of his face is shown
for the first time. The face is shadowed with a stubby-growth, and his
hair is now shoulder-length. He could be in his forties; overall, he looks
very different - - much older - - from the Snake in the last title. Only
the signature blue bandana reminds observers of the younger commando form
the Shadow Moses chapter. The stealth suit is not a top of the line
military issue, but the old gear from Shadow Moses, showing signs of
repair in several places. No protectors are in evidence, only a Beretta
worn on the hip holster. Snake looks toward the stern, the windlass at his
back. The electric carnival of the George Washington Bridge retreats into
the distance, and the Manhattan nightscape on the opposite shore flows
into the thick night.

To Scene T00b1R Opening Codec Demo

SCENE T00b1R Opening Codec Demo
Codec screen

Snake calls up Otacon. To Codec Screen.
Otacon looks more mature than in the previous installment. Same pair of
glasses, to all appearances.

Snake:
	This is Snake. Do you read me, Otacon?
Otacon:
	Loud and clear Snake.
Snake:
	Kept you waiting huh? (the comment is directed to the player) I’m
	at the ‘sneak point’.
Otacon:
	Everything going okay?
Snake:
	The stealth camo’s busted. Landing impact.
Otacon:
	We must have overused it. Sorry but you’re going to have to deal
	with it. You’re not in the military anymore.
Snake:
	Right, I didn’t plan on relying on this gadget anyway.
Otacon:
	The private sectors not so bad, is it? Privacy guaranteed
Snake:
	I’m happy as long as no one gives me any more unwanted gifts.
Otacon:
	You mean that thing with Naomi?
Snake:
	And I can’t say I miss the chattering nanny.
Otacon:
	Mei ling’s not so bad. That reminds me, I have to get in touch
	with her again about that new Watik flashware.
Snake:
	Diverting toys from the SSCEN (U.S. Army Soldier Systems Center)
	again? Give her a message from me: someone will find out, sooner
	or later. She’s better off assuming it’s sooner and quit while
	she’s safe.
Otacon:
	Too true. Okay, Snake, let’s get to work.
Otacon:
	You know how the technical specs of Metal Gear were sold on the
	black market after Shadow Moses?
Snake:
	All Ocelot’s doing.
Otacon:
	Exactly. And every state, group and dotcom has its own version of
	Metal Gear.
Snake:
	Not exactly a classified weapon for today’s nuclear powers.
Otacon:
	This new one seems to have been designed to mop the floor with all
	the other models. The only consistent description is that it’s an
	amphibious, anti-Metal Gear vehicle...
Snake:
	That explains why this one is under Marine Corps jurisdiction.

To Scene T01a1D Objective Briefing Demo

SCENE T01a1D Objective Discussion Demo
The image of the disguised tanker streaming up the Hudson River (receding).

Otacon:
	The mission objective is to make visual confirmation of the new
	Metal Gear being transported by that tanker and bring back
	photographic evidence.
Otacon:
	But I want you first to go up to the top level of the
	infrastructure, to the bridge. We need to find out where the
	tanker is headed.
Snake:
	A little reconnaissance, huh?
Otacon:
	There’s too much we don’t know about this new prototype.
	Capabilities, deployment method - - we don’t even know how close
	it is to completion. If we know where the testing arena is, I can
	start to draw some reasonable conclusions.
Snake:
	All right. I’ll head to the bridge. ASAP.
Otacon:
	Try to avoid confrontations. Our goal is to collect evidence on
	Metal Gear development and expose it to the world. It would be
	best if you could get out of there without alerting anyone.
Snake:
	Don’t worry. I know the drill - - we’re not terrorists.
Otacon:
	Very good. Don’t forget that you’re part of Philanthropy now
	- - an anti-Metal Gear organization and officially recognized by
	the UN.
Snake:
	Recognized, but still fringe, Otacon.

To Scene T01b1G Explanation of Equipment

SCENE T01b1G Explanation of Equipment

Return to game screen. Display Weapons Window and introduce the equipment.

Otacon:
	All right: let’s take a look at your gear.
Otacon:
	Your weapon is a tranquilizer gun converted from a Beretta M92F.

Display Beretta

Snake:
	M9...
Otacon:
	It’s a little hard to work with, since you’ll have to reload after
	each shot since the slide locks.

Shift to FPV screen. Aim the gun and the Beretta’s sight appears on the
screen.

Snake:
	Better than scavenging at the mission site. Good suppressor too.
Otacon:
	The chemical stun will take effect in seconds and last for hours.
	You can take down an elephant with that thing. Check out the laser
	sighting too.

Snake aims the gun and strafes left and right, giving a demo of a FPV. The
red gleam of the laser sight can be seen at the end of the M9’s barrel.

Otacon:
	The effects of the anesthetic round will vary depending on what
	part of the body is hit. We’re talking about a difference of ten’s
	of seconds between hitting limbs, chest or head.

End of weapons briefing. Return to game screen and onto equipment.

Otacon:
	As far as equipment

Open equipment window. The first item is cigarettes.

Otacon:
	Hey Snake! Cigarettes? What’s wrong with you?
Snake:
	It’s kind of a lucky charm.
Otacon:
	You haven’t read the Surgeon General’s warning, have you?

Next the camera appears.

Otacon:
	Here’s the digital camera. Works almost the same way as your old
	one.

To Scene T02a1D Camera Tutorial Demo
Deck of the tanker

The Item Window vanishes from the screen. Snake is concealed behind the
giant windlass on the deck. He aims the camera, substituting it for
binoculars, to survey the superstructure (behind the crew’s quarters) and
guard stations.

Maintenance workers (sentries) dressed in rain gear can be seen patrolling
decks B, D, and E of the superstructure (crew’s quarters).

Snake:
	They don’t look armed...

Snake zooms in on their hands and murmurs

Otacon:
	Hey, Earth to Snake. These are nice, upstanding Marines, not
	terrorists. Don’t get caught; you’re in stealth mode here.
Snake:
	Sure. And if it comes to that, a little beauty sleep never hurt
	anyone.

Pan camera up and down. At least three sentries are in evidence.

Snake:
	By the way, Otacon, are you sure of this intelligence?
Otacon:
	Absolutely. Hacked it out of the Pentagon’s classified files myself.
Snake:
	No traces?
Otacon:
	Oh please. I’m too good for that.
Snake:
But this might be a trap. Remember, there’s a price on our heads.
Otacon:
You’re just being paranoid.
Snake:
I hope so.

Snake:
	Those men - - you wouldn’t think they were anything but civilians
	from here.
Otacon:
	With all the ships passing on the river and in the harbor, putting
	uniformed Marines on the deck would be a bad idea. People can get
	a clear view of the water from riverside too.

Pan camera to right as Otacon talks. A mass of buildings cast their light
faintly through the downpour.

Snake:
	The waterline is too high According to the navigational plans,
	this ship should have discharged its cargo upriver.
Otacon:
	It’s in there. No doubt about it.
Snake:
	The military trains you to watch for threats from the stern of the
	boat. That’s SOP for counter-terror ops too. Security should be
	tighter.
Otacon:
	You worry too much.
Otacon:
	Satellite surveillance is a major international pastime these
	days. I’d say the cargo holds, safely below deck. Do you see the
	entrance to the holds?

Snake zooms in with the camera, searching for a way in.

Snake:
	Looks like there are a few entryways into the crew’s quarters.

Suddenly he picks up the whine of a helicopter nearby.

Snake:
	A chopper?

A sudden disturbance in the scene framed by the camera. Snake lets out an
exclamation.

Snake:
	What - - !

A figure materializes behind one of the crewmen patrolling the deck, and a
blade flashes at the sentry’s throat. Even at a distance, Snake can see
the blood. The victim, rendered silent by a hand clamped over his mouth,
is helpless against a clearly professional killer. The man behind him
wears a brownish camouflage gear and a balaclava, through which only his
eyes show. On his back is a boxy rucksack. Snake pans the camera to upper
left, just in time to witness another camouflaged newcomer cut a crewman’s
throat.

Snake:
	Looks like we’re not the only ones after Metal Gear tonight.
Otacon:
	Is that a chopper I just heard?
Snake:
	Affirmative. Probably another cavalry

Snake searches for the third crewman at the location of his last check.
The sentry has already bee killed, and a camouflaged figure is dragging
his body along. The camera tracks to the left, and captures the attacked
tipping the body over the low deck railings into the river.

Snake:
	What’s their game? Hijack?
Otacon:
	They’re probably targeting the ship’s controls.
Snake:
	Otacon, how many men do you need to take over a tanker of this
	size?
Otacon:
	The ship is run by computer so I’d say about 18 people.

The camera, once again on the superstructure area. The camouflaged figures
have finished disposing of the bodies. Having taken up their stations and
checked their gear, each now sports an AKS-74u, the stock extended and a
silencer affixed to the muzzle.

Snake:
AKS-74u?

Snake pans the camera until his eyes come to rest on an older
(late 60’s-70’s) man. He wears a fur coat and is giving orders to the
soldiers, gesticulating with his arms. Though the rain continues to beat
down, the man appears utterly indifferent to its force, and clearly
belongs to the same class of men as the camouflaged figures. Snake zooms
into the man’s face. He wears a fur hat instead of a balaclava, his coat
collars are up framing a conspicuous moustache. This is Colonel Gurlukovich.

The colonel seizes a radio clipped to the chest of one of the soldiers and
shouts something into it.

Snake:
	Russians...?

Having completed the communication, he thrusts the radio back to its
owner. His imperious air and the complete attention he commands from the
soldier suggest both his years and status as a military man.

Otacon:
	You sure?
Snake:
	No Marine barber touched that head of hair.

Snake presses the shutter and the man’s image is automatically saved. The
face momentarily freezes on the screen.

Snake:
	I’m transmitting a photo. Let’s get an ID on him ASAP.
Otacon:
	I’m on it.

To Scene T03a1D Enter Kamov

SCENE T03a1D Enter Kamov
Deck of the tanker

At that moment the drone of the choppers (2 crafts) starts up again. (The
sound of the guerilla transport departing after depositing its human cargo).

Snake:
	Looks like the tanker’s theirs now.

Snake is looking up at the pouring sky; the choppers cannot be seen, but
Snake identifies the model from the turbine sound. (Because Kamov’s are
equipped with a Fenestron-type tail rotor, they make a distinctly
different sound in flight).

Snake:
	KA-60 Kasatka
Otacon:
	Kasatka? Kamov chopper, right? Killer Whale...

To Scene T03b1R Post Kamov Codec demo

SCENE T03b1R Post Kamov Codec demo
Codec Screen

Snake:
	We need to get a fix on who they are.
Otacon:
	Judging by their transport, aren’t they some kind of military
	commandos?
Snake:
	Not necessarily. It could be the KA-62, the civil model.
Otacon:
	(becoming uneasy) Look Snake, all we need is the photographic
	evidence of Metal Gear (as though trying to soothe Snake).
Otacon:
	As long as we have it; we can put it online and blow the whole
	thing wide open. So no pyrotechnics. Okay?
Snake:
	All right, I’ll try my best.
Otacon:
	This isn’t like Shadow Moses. Reach me if anything happens.
Otacon:
	The frequency is 141.12.
Snake:
	How can I check in and save my progress?
Otacon:
	I’ll do it. There’s a frequency set aside for it - - 140.96. Sorry
	but no Mei Ling this time.
Otacon:
	Call me on Codec when you want to save.
Snake:
	Got it.
Otacon:
	I’ll be waiting just past the Verrazano Bridge. You need to be off
	that ship by then.
Snake:
	I’ll be in touch.

To the game.

SCENE T04a1D On the superstructure, Kamov Discovery demo
Tanker superstructure

Snake moves across the storm-lashed deck and infiltrates the tanker’s
interior. He reaches the superstructure without being spotted.
Snake walks up to the window in front of him; beyond the steadily sweeping
wiper is the helm. The tanker is plowing its way forward through the rough
water. A particularly huge wave washes over the main deck from time to
time. Two large transport helicopters (Kamovs) hover over the deck.
Overcome by a sudden flashback to Shadow Moses, Snake murmurs:

Snake:
	So it is the Kasatka’s... Russian choppers...!

The black Kasatkas look futuristic, and the design of the signature
Fenestron Type tail rotors add to the distinctly un-Russian impression.

The high winds make it difficult for the helicopters to maintain their
balance, and the two crafts give each other a wide berth, one below the
other, to prevent collision. Cables are thrown down from the choppers and
soldiers, armed to the teeth, descend with fluid rapidity. Through the
drench(ing?) waves and near gale-force wind.

They are the Gurlukovich guards. Snipers on both helicopters keep watch
over the men. Once on the deck, the soldier’s quickly infiltrate the
tanker’s interior through the various entryways: the precision of the
process implies a thorough training. Having boarded with the last man onto
the ship, the choppers veer up.

SCENE T04a0R Infrastructure Codec demo, additions

After the screenplay demo where Snake determines the tanker’s course
Codec screen

Otacon:
	Snake, did you find out where that ship is headed?
Snake:
	I’m looking at it - - 35 degrees longitude, latitude around 58.
Otacon:
	More tan 500 miles off the coast of the Bermudas, out in the
	middle of the Atlantic So the prototype is ready for solo testing
	 it’s basically combat-worthy. That area is outside the second
	Fleet’s operational range too. It must be a stand-alone Marine
	project  which means this prototype Metal Gear must be designed
	for independent deployment, without any Naval assistance...
Otacon:
	Anyway, analysis can wait till later. Snake, you need to go down
	to the holds and locate the actual Metal - -
Snake:
	(spotting a shadowy figure outside of the window)!?

Return to game

SCENE T051D Pre-Olga Battle Demo
Outside the tanker superstructure (5F)

Snake exits from the port entryway. The faint sound of radio communications
can be heard through the rainstorm. A woman’s figure is silhouetted at a
slightly higher point. Snake quickly finds concealment behind some
structures (cargo containers etc.). Olga leans against the railing outside
the superstructure, on the deck. From her radio issues the voice of her
father, Colonel Gurlukovich.

Gurlukovich(off):
	...Shalashaska has landed. I’m on my way to the tanker holds...
	Report your status.

The Colonel’s voice is tense and intermittent, as though in motion. Olga
presses the radio against her ear, trying to make out his words. Olga is
dressed in camouflage pants, combat boots and military-issue tank top. The
last bears the distinct horizontal striping of the Russian Army, and in
the rain, her drabes have a flattering effect the Army never intended. A
large PSS pistol and an NR-2 Special Scout Knife are strapped to her waist,
and an Army cap is pulled down over her forehead, shading her face. Only
the firmly closed mouth is visible. She is wiry in build, her muscular
frame almost boyish. A hint of Meryl can be detected.

Olga:
	Control room, communications and engine room are under control. All
	entry and exit points to the tanker holds secured. Infrared sensors
	placed and operational.

Gurlukovich(off):
	Good work. Are the explosives in place?

Olga, as though eager to please:

Olga:
	Yes, they’re all planted.

Gurlukovich(off):
	Listen. Once we have what we came for, the tanker will be scuttled.

Olga half turns. As a result, Snake can now hear the voice from the radio
more clearly. He edges toward Olga with his Beretta ready (almost a crawl).

Olga:
	And the vehicle’s pilot?
Gurlukovich(off):
	He’s the only one who underwent the VR training. No one else can
	do it.
Olga:
	(concern for her father) Are you sure you can trust him?
Gurlukovich(off):
	Your art in this mission is complete. You are to leave at once.
Olga:
	No, it’s not over yet!

She shakes her head in dogged defiance.

Gurlukovich(off):
	I can see the moon... even in this storm. Pale as death. I have a
	bad feeling about this mission...

Snake pokes his head up and manages to look at Olga. He mistakes her
momentarily for Meryl. The rain is starting to let up.

Snake:
Chri - - ! (shocked, thinking it’s Meryl)
Gurlukovich(off):
	You swore this to me. That you would leave the unit, once the
	mission was complete.

Olga shakes her head vehemently.

Gurlukovich(off):
	Do not worry. This is a country of liberty.
Olga:
	No! This is where I belong, with the unit. I have nowhere else to
	go.

Olga pulls the gun out of the holster. She cradles the 7.62 mm PSS pistol
against her chest, as though reassuring herself.

Olga:
	Father, I want to stay and fight.
Gurlukovich(off):
	There is no choice to make here Olga!
Gurlukovich(off):
	Need I remind you that you are carrying my grandchild?
Olga:
	...

She silently stares down at her own stomach and gently places a hand on it
(about 3 months pregnant. No clue as to the identity of the father).

Gurlukovich(off):
	You will be on the helicopter out of here, now!

The radio abruptly shuts off.

Olga:
	Damn it!

Olga stares at the radio and lets out a frustrated sound. In her right
hand is the PSS pistol.
The chopper’s roar grows louder; one has already taken off from the deck
and is away. Olga waves away the other chopper, but the pilot (on the
right hand side)  still gestures toward the chopper. Olga indicates a
refusal. And after hesitating momentarily, the chopper turns and speeds
away. Olga stares at the departing craft, lowering the radio to waist
level.

Snake:
	Freeze!

Snake takes aim with the Beretta and moves towards Olga. (He is unwilling
to shoot because of the resemblance to Meryl and the desire to know her
identity.)
Olga notices Snake’s presence for the first time.

Snake:
	Hands over your head! Now!

Olga slowly complies, trying to buy time. Her underarms are unshaven.
Snake stands still, his gun pointed straight at her brow.

Snake:
	Toss your gun overboard! Slowly.

Olga, seeing the look in Snake’s eyes, makes up her mid (it helps that
she has a second gun concealed behind her back). She takes her PSS pistol
with the silencer and throws it in a wide arc into the sea. The PSS
disappears into the mist.
Snake, slightly more relaxed now, beings interrogating her. The distance
between them is approximately 10 m (about 35 feet).

Snake:
	A woman...? Show your face.
Olga:
	You men - - you’re all the same.

Olga takes off her cap and lets the wind snatch it from her hand. Snake’s
hands tense at Olga’s action but he still does not fire.

Olga reveals a short, boyish head of hair and a large scar on her left
cheek. She is expressionless, without a trace of fear.

Snake:
	Who are you?
Olga:
	We are nomads. Wanderers.

Olga, hands still raised, is inching sideways. She had an USP tucked in
behind her back. She is waiting for a chance to get the weapon. Snake
trains his gun on her, closing in:

Snake:
	I said don’t move!
Olga:
	Americans... so you shoot women too?
Snake:
	I’m a nomad too.

Olga grins.

Olga:
	Hmm (implying camaraderie)...
Snake:
	What else do you have there?

Snake spots the knife on Olga’s belt.

Snake:
	Take the knife and toss it.

Olga has an idea. Still keeping her gaze on Snake, she slowly pulls the
knife out of its sheath, pointing the tip toward herself. She leans down
to place the knife on the deck.

Snake:
	Not there. Toss in overboard!

Snake indicated the river with a jerk of his head. Olga straightens up and
glares at Snake defiantly. Snake, suspicions aroused, is trying to watch
his back.

Snake:
	Hold that position. Now, turn around.

Olga, impressed smiles.

Olga:
	You know what your doing.

As Olga slowly starts to turn, another wave hits the ship and rocks it.
The spray washes over Olga. Suddenly, she murmurs in a strangely sultry
voice.

Olga:
	It’s stopped raining...

She looks up at the sky. The rain has stopped and the sky is momentarily
clear. Behind Olga is the familiar Manhattan nightscape, with the Statue
of Liberty. A full moon broods over a cluster of skyscrapers. Olga raises
her hands skyward.

Olga:
	(Her face still upraised) Not too shabby, is it? New York, I mean?

Olga delivers her line with a flourish, she is seeking to divert Snake’s
attention with the performance and she succeeds. Snake’s watchfulness
falters for an instant at her sudden change of mood. Olga points the grip
of the knife towards Snake and pulls the inset trigger. The chamber
concealed within the grip propels a single round at Snake. Snake, having
noticed the sudden jerk of Olga’s tricep, bends backward to dodge the
bullet.

Snake:
	! (gasps as he moves out of the bullets way)

Having forced Snake’s attention away from herself, Olga immediately
conceals herself, leaving the knife to lie where it fell. She pulls out
the Usp form behind her back with a fluid motion.
Snake regains his balance and quickly finds his own cover. The cloud
covers the moon and the rain starts to fall again. Olga turns her face to
the sky, catching the rain.

Olga:
	And that brings our tour to its conclusion!

SCENE T06a1D Olga Battle victory demo
Outside the tanker’s superstructure (5F)

Snake emerges victorious from a gunfight with Olga.
Olga falls to the deck, unconscious. Because Snake’s gun fires anesthetic
rounds, she is not permanently harmed. Snake walks up to Olga and acquires
the USP pistol lying by her side. There is no ammo left. Snake raises his
eyebrows at the fact that Olga’s preferred sidearm is an American gun.

Snake:
	Hmm...

The rain and the wind step up in force. Snake examines his recent foe, but
finds no clues. Through the hoarse whistling of the gale, a steady drone
approaches. Snake turns around to discover a donut-shaped remote camera
(surveillance craft) suspended in mid-air. The camera’s lens is focused on
Snake, and a red glow of laser beam flanks the lens. The thing resembles
an airborne jellyfish.

Snake:
	CYPHER!

The remote camera zips away and disappears into the rain. Snake raises
Otacon on the Codec.

Snake:
	Otacon, the ship appears to be under their control. The men have
	Russian gear, but I haven’t been able to find out anything else
	about their origin.
Otacon:
	(seriously) I know who they are.
Snake:
	You do?
Otacon:
	We’ve ID’d the old man.
Snake:
	Who is he?
Otacon:
	Sergei Gurlukovich.
Snake:
	Gurlukovich...! One of Ocelot’s allies?
Otacon:
	Yeah... The GRU colonel. He’s the one Ocelot was supposed to meet
	up with, after Shadow Moses...

Jump cut to several pics from MGS1. A frame of Ocelot and Liquid Snake in
the command chamber of the Metal Gear silo.

Snake:
	They’re after Metal Gear.
Otacon:
	Everything’s changed. This is not going to be as simple as we
	thought.
Snake:
	You could say that I aw a surveillance remote just now; it looked
	like the CYPHER.
Otacon:
	A marine CYPHER-T?
Snake:
	No, Army.
Otacon:
	(uneasily) First the Marines, then the Russians - - now the
	(American) Army...?
Snake:
	You’re right, this isn’t going to be simple.
Otacon:
	(thinks hard, then) Snake - - (reluctantly) There’s something I
	have to tell you.
Snake:
	What?
Otacon:
	We didn’t dig up this info - - about the new Metal Gear - - on our
	own. Not like usual...
Snake:
	How did you find out, then?
Otacon:
	It was a tip. An anonymous tip.
Snake:
	Anonymous? You’ve never trusted those - - why would you start now?
Otacon:
	I ah - - (slightly awkwardly) I have a younger sister. A
	stepsister. We have different parents...
Otacon:
	I only knew here for two years.
Snake:
	You never mentioned her before. So...?
Otacon:
	The sender of the tip was ‘E.E.’.
Snake:
	‘E.E’ ?
Otacon:
	Her name is Emma, but I always called her ‘E.E.’...
Snake:
	Emma Emmerich?
Otacon:
	Yeah, it just caught my eye, you know? I figured it was a
	coincidence, but I couldn’t get it out of my mind. There’s really
	no one out there who knows about her.

Snake:
	When was the last time you saw her?
Otacon:
	Over 10 years ago.
Snake:
	You think it’s a trap? To lure us out here...?
Otacon:
	I don’t know. After I got the tip, I did break into the Pentagon
	system to get confirmation.
Snake:
	Okay...
Otacon:
	Watch you back Snake. Maybe I screwed up.
Snake:
	I’ve got a light equipped USP; I can take them on now. There’s no
	ammo, but it takes a 9mm, just like the Marines’ M9. I’ll find
	those somewhere around here.
Otacon:
	Don’t raise too much racket with that thing.
Snake:
	I hear you.

A small room off the engine room (starboard side)

Having defeated Olga and descended to the tanker’s lower level, Snake
finds himself in a small room. The engine room is just ahead. A giant
shadow has been cast on the wall in front of him. It is a figure of a man,
wearing what appears to be a massive barrel shaped tank on his back and a
great cannon-like weapon cradled in his arms. The shadow is obviously that
of Vulcan Raven from the previous title.

Two Gurlukovich guards (A and B) on the other side of a dividing wall.
Gurlukovich guard B closes the hatch; Gurlukovich guard B takes out his
radio and contacts his leader. Guard A begins to carefully tighten the
hatch handle. Snake, hidden behind the wall, listens to the radio
communication.

Gurlukovich guard A:
	Colonel, we have sealed the stern hatch
Gurlukovich (OFF):
	All right.
Gurlukovich guard A:
	The lift is also under our control.

Gurlukovich guard B finishes sealing the hatch.

Gurlukovich guard B:
	Phew.
Gurlukovich (OFF):
	We’re on the foredeck, about to descend to the holds.
Gurlukovich guard A:
	Sir, the Marine commander has started his speech already.
Gurlukovich (OFF):
	We will complete the preparations before the end of the speech.
Gurlukovich guard A:
	All communications to the holds have been severed. No one is aware
	of our presence.
Gurlukovich (OFF):
	Let no one down into the holds until we are out.
Gurlukovich guard A:
	Yes sir! We will secure your exit, with our lives if necessary.

SCENE T09a1D Ocelot and soldier demo
Tanker’s holds

Snake crosses the threshold into the tanker’s holds and finds himself in
the lower parts of the ship. Normally, these giant tanks would hold crude
oil, but because of the ships true purpose - - the transport of Metal Gear
- - the tanks are empty. The landing below the hatch is over 70 feet above
the floor, and there is an orderly row of Marine commandos lined up below.
Their attention is on a large screen on the wall. There are approximately
50 men, in four rows; they are watching their Commandant’s speech on the
monitor.

Gurlukovich guard A closes the watertight door (does not lock it)

Gurlukovich guard A:
	(small sigh)

Footsteps approach, (cowboy boots, with spurs) in a slow, measured gait.
The soldier raises his head. The outline resolves itself into a man with
long hair and duster (Ocelot). The guard pulls out a gun.

Gurlukovich guard A:
	Who goes there!

The man continues walking forward, ignoring the soldier’s query. The light
is behind him, and his face is in the shadows. The footsteps grow louder.
The guard finally recognizes the interloper, and lowers his weapon.

Gurlukovich guard A:
	Oh, Shalashaska.

The man steps in front of the guard. The latter, relieved, allows his
guard to drop.

Gurlukovich guard A:
	Why are you here? We thought you were with the colonel.

The man raises his own weapon. The muzzle gleams in the dark. The gun is
a single action revolver. The guard stares, unbelieving.

Gurlukovich guard A:
	What the - - !

His exclamation us cut short by the impact of a bullet through his
forehead. Ocelot fires a short burst at the hapless guard’s head and
chest, sending two rounds into each target.

Gurlukovich guard A:
	(screams)

The killer slips the gun back into his holster with practiced movement
and tightly seals the hatch. The clang echoes down the long corridor.

Ocelot:
	The colonel will be joining you soon... Comrade...

Ocelot departs leisurely, his coat flapping.

Otacon:
	All right. We’ll use another recovery course.
Snake:
	They may be planning to change course.

Snake:

Otacon:
	If the deck I sealed off, they have no way of knowing that the
	ship’s been taken over.
Snake:
	I’m not interested in fighting these guys. The weapons won’t do me
	much good here.
Otacon:
	Can you see Metal Gear?
Snake:
	No, I’ll have to go around to the bow. They have some serious
	defenses here. I doubt the recent arrivals want to blast their way
	through the Marines either.
Otacon:
	Wonder where they’re headed.

Otacon:
	Okay Snake, let’s just go over this one more time.
Otacon:
	Use this camera to get photographic evidence of the Metal Gear
	prototype.
Otacon:
	Great. Now do your thing and take pictures that speak louder than
	the government’s plausible denials.
Otacon:
	We need four shots: Metal Gear from the front, front-right, and
	front-left, and a close up of the Marine Corp marking.
Snake:
	Marking?
Otacon:
	There should be a ‘Marines’ insignia on the body of the Metal
	Gear. Just let someone try explaining away a clear shot of that.
	As soon as you have the images, use the codec to transmit them in
	an encrypted burst. If they make the grade, we’ll go from there.
Snake:
	All right.
Otacon:
	There’s actually one little thing...
Snake:
	Just spit it out, I’m used to things going wrong.
Otacon:
	It looks like someone’s monitoring our transmission. [Turns out to
	be the ‘Patriots’.]
Snake:
	Who?
Otacon:
	I don’t have a clue. All they’re doing is watching - it would
	creep me out less if they tried to interfere with our
	communications.
Snake:
	Could it have something to do with that Cypher we saw?
Otacon:
	Maybe. I’ve switched the encryption protocol for our burst
	transmissions for now. What I want to do is to use a different
	method for sending those photos. Just in case.
Snake:
	Instead of using the Codec?
Otacon:
	Exactly. There’s a workstation in the southeast corner of the
	block where Metal Gear is housed. I’ve made arrangements so that
	you can send the pictures from the machine.
Snake:
	‘Arrangements’.
Otacon:
	I hitched a ride on Link-16 into U.S. military’s proprietary
	network. I managed to get into that workstation and overwrote a
	part of the system software so I could remote-install a little
	app I wrote...
Snake:
	(complete dummy when it comes to computers) Why bother with
	anything that complicated 
Otacon:
	No, it’s pretty simple, really. Look, all you have to do is stand
	in front of that machine and push the Action button. The app will
	automatically launch and download the image data from the camera,
	split the files and encrypt them individually. The data packets
	can then masquerade as 
Snake:
	(Impatient with all the techno babble, interrupts Otacon) OK, OK.
	So all I have to do is push the Action button in front of the
	computer once I have the pictures, right?
Otacon:
	(Slightly sulkily from having his lecture cut off) Well, sure, if
	you put it that way.
Otacon:
	And one more thing the Commandants’s already begun his speech,
	but you need to get the pictures before he’s done talking.
	Otherwise they’ll spot you. OK?
Snake:
	How much time do I have?
Otacon:
	I hacked into his personal files and took a look at the text of
	that speech. I’d say you have 5 more minutes - - longer if he
	throws in a joke or two.
Snake:
	A five minute time limit, huh?

One more take:

Otacon:
	I hacked into his personal files and took a look at the text of
	that speech. I’d say you have seven more minutes - - longer if he
	throws in a joke or two.
Snake:
	A seven minute time limit, huh?

One more take:

Otacon:
	I hacked into his personal files and took a look at the text of
	that speech. I’d say you have eight more minutes - - longer if he
	throws in a joke or two.
Snake:
	A eight minute time limit, huh?

One more take:

Otacon:
	I hacked into his personal files and took a look at the text of
	that speech. I’d say you have ten more minutes - - longer if he
	throws in a joke or two.
Snake:
	A ten minute time limit, huh?

Otacon:
	Remember, Snake, just the photos, OK?
Snake:
	With these kinds of odds, I won’t be making any sudden moves.
Snake:
	But that doesn’t mean we can just let Metal Gear be hijacked.
Otacon:
	Okay, okay, but first, the photos
Snake:
	All right. We’ll deal with the rest when we get there.
Otacon:
	Stay low.
Snake:
	The elevator is inactive. I’m using the ladder.

SCENE T11a1D In the Bow of the Ship, Enter Metal Gear Demo.

Snake enters the forward (helm) block of the holds. The gigantic shape of
Metal Gear RAY looms ahead. The new incarnation had the kind of presence
and heavy, brooding feel that bears no resemblance to its predecessor.
But a closer look betrays subtle details that remind the players of the
REX model. The new Metal Gear, lit by the dim phosphorescence of the
tanker holds, is almost organic, with the parched look of a beached marine
creature. It’s surface appears to owe more to biology than metallurgy,
almost opalescent, with the soft gloss of sea shells. Because of the
lighting, only the legs and head (beak) are completely visible. The unit
is clearly combat worthy.

Right in front of RAY (at its feet), a small podium has been erected. The
Commandant of the Marine Corps is standing on the podium, giving a speech.
About twenty marines stand in rigid formation listening. Snake is
overwhelmed by Metal Gear’s sheer power.

Snake:
	...Metal Gear!? (echo of the line in the previous title)

The camera pans up from behind Snake. A long shot of the tanler’s
interior. The camera takes in the whole of Metal Gear RAY. Title

       To "Metal Gear Escapes"



SCENE T12a1D The Seizure of Metal gear Demo
Tanker Holds, Bow of the ship. In front of Metal Gear

Snake creeps from blind spot to blind spot, evading the Marines, and takes
the necessary photos.

At the same time, the Commandant finishes his speech and salutes the
Marines. The men immediately snap to attention and return the salute. A
dull crash reverberates through the holds, and Snake flattens himself
behind a pillar. Suddenly, a very dry clap starts up from somewhere (does
not ring out since one hand is balled into a fist).

The Marines maintain their posture, but their eyes move furiously, trying
to locate the sound. The Commandant is also attempting to determine who is
responsible.

Ocelot:
	Excellent speech, my friend...
CMC:
	Who the...!?

The sarcastic clapping ends and footsteps can now be heard, accompanied
by the jingle of spurs. The man is walking out from behind (and at the
foot of) Metal Gear RAY. Snake leans out from behind the column.

A man (Ocelot) emerges from the darkness.

Ocelot:
	Gift of the silver tongue - - they say it’s the mark of a good
	officer.

Both of Ocelot’s arms swing free by his side. The right hand is blanched
from the elbow down, the fingers twisted into a deformed fist. A glimpse
of a gun belt underneath the coat, a single-action Army pistol in the
holster. Ocelot’s expression cannot be read.

Ocelot:
	...and a liar. Americans are too in love with the sound of their
	own voices to speak the truth.

The Commandant watches ocelot warily. (Since the other man does not hold
a weapon, he is truly alarmed)

CMC:
	Identify yourself!

The Marines position themselves around the podium and raise their weapons
in unison. Ocelot smiles wolfishly.

Ocelot:
	I am Shalashaska! Also called Revolver...

Snake mutters uncontrollably in his hiding place. His line is uttered at
the same time as Ocelot

Ocelot:
	Ocelot.
Snake:
	Ocelot!!

Jump out to several images from MGS1. A single shot of Ocelot.

The men are itching to take action; the Commandant restrains them with a
motion. He is relatively relaxed, sure of his safety under their
protection.

CMC:
	What do you want?
Ocelot:
	This machine will be quite useful.
CMC:
	What are you planning to do - - steal this thing?
Ocelot:
	Steal? No, no, I’m taking it back.

The Commandant smiles in derision at Ocelot’s reply. Snake moves from
column to column, slipping closer to the front. The Marine’s attention is
on the podium, and no one notices Snake.

All of a sudden, Gurlukovich noiselessly appears behind the Commandant
and pins his arms against his side. The Commandant is momentarily struck
mute by the pressure of a Makhalov (pistol) jabbed against his throat. The
Marines are startled , at a loss as to what to do.
Snake moves in closer to the podium to get a better look at the new
arrival.

Snake:
	Gurlukovich...

Ocelot raises his voice and addresses the Marines.

Ocelot:
	Nobody move! Understand?

Gurlukovich, still holding the Commandant in a tight grip, slowly begins
to back away. The scene is being relayed in real time to the men in the
stern block via the camera. The Marines break into an uproar.

Marine:
	Cmmandant!
Marine:
	What the - -!?
Marine:
	What is it?
Marine:
	What’s going on!?
Marine:
	What the hell?
Marine:
	Who is that?
Marine:
- - the hell’s going on around here!?
Marine:
	This is messed up!
Marine:
	(exclamations of surprise)
etc...

CMC:
	...

Ocelot slowly raises his right hand to show the Marines something.

Ocelot:
	This ship now carries enough SMETEX on its key structural points
to blow it out of the water - - at the touch of this button.

The Marines gaze at the transmitter in Ocelot’s hand in shock.

The shocked Marines:

Marine:
	(exclamations of surprise)
Marine:
	(gasps)
Marine:
	This is nuts...
Ocelot:
	That’s right - - no on has to die needlessly.

Several coils of wire drop down from above and Gurlukovich guards (3-5)
in camouflage descend rapidly to the holds. Once on the floor, the guards
surround the Marines, their weapons raised against the American soldiers.
Several of the guards position themselves near Metal Gear RAY’s leg and
back and begins the initiation sequence.

Ocelot:
	We’re almost at the target. Get a move on!

The Commandant recovers some of his calm and rasps out:

CMC:
	What do you intend to do with RAY - - sell it on the streets?
Gurlukovich:
	I was raised in Snezhinsk, formerly known as Chelyabinsk -70, the
	nuclear research outpost.
CMC:
	What are you talking about?
Gurlukovich:
	After the Cold War ended, my home was bought out by the Americans.
CMC:
	Is there a point to this story?
Gurlukovich:
	None that you would understand. Land, friends, dignity A;; sold
	to the highest bidder, - - the United States of America. Even the
	technology that gave birth to these weapons is Russian, developed
	by us!
CMC:
	What do you intend to do?
Gurlukovich:
	Russia will rise again - - and RAY is the key.

Gurlukovich glances at Ocelot, seeking a show of solidarity. But Ocelot
starts to laugh, caressing the transmitter in his left hand.

Ocelot:
	I regret to inform you  that I have no intention of selling Metal
	Gear. As I said, I came to take it back.

Gurlukovich is stunned by Ocelot’s words.

Ocelot:
	Yes - - returned. To the ‘Patriots’

The CMC jerks violently at the mention of the ‘Patriots.

CMC:
	The ‘La-li-lu-le-lo’! How is that - - possible!?

Gurlukovich gazes at Ocelot with growing suspicion.

Gurlukovich:
	Ocelot, you - - ! Have you sold us out?
Ocelot:
	I was never in you employ, Gurlukovich.
Gurlukovich:
	Are you still in league with Solidus!?
Ocelot:
	No hard feelings, Colonel. Mother Russia can rot for all I care.
Gurlukovich:
	Since when, Ocelot! When did you turn?
Ocelot:
	I’m glad you noticed comrade. I abandoned ‘her’ during the Cold
	War.
Gurlukovich:
	Hah---!

The colonel is trembling with rage. Ocelot calls out to the Gurlukovich
guards.

Ocelot:
	Metal Gear has room for one!

The Gurlukovich guards waiting for a cue from the colonel, are showing
signs of confusion.

Ocelot:
	Gurlukovich, you and your daughter will die here.
Gurlukovich:
	Damn you !!

Gurlukovich releases the CMC and shoves him forward.

CMC:
	(groans at the sudden impact)

Gurlukovich’s Makhalov swerves towards Ocelot. At the same time, Ocelot
throws his duster into the air, like  matador flourishing his cloak. The
coat sails out, twisting and rippling (high-speed shot) in front of
Gurlukovich, blocking his view. (The cloak is organic in behavior and
texture.) The CMC stumbles forward.

Gurlukovich:
	Die, you dog!

Gurlukovich fires, and a hole appears on the duster. Ocelot, however, is
no longer in the bullet’s trajectory. He moves in rhythm to the duster’s
progress, shielding himself from view as he pulls out his revolver with
his left hand. He fires six rounds in rapid succession; the slugs punch
through the coat.

Gurlukovich:
	(cry of pain and anger as the shots find their mark)
CMC:
	(cry of pain and anger as the shots land)

When the duster clears the camera’s view, the bodies of Colonel
Gurlukovich and the CMC are revealed lying on the floor, riddled with
bullets. Ocelot tosses his emptied gun away without a glance.

Ocelot:
	Sergei! Looks like you were long overdue for retirement.
Gurlukovich:
	T-traitorous dog...

The colonel’s face hits the floor. The Gurlukovich guards confronted with
the evidence of the colonel’s wounds (several rounds in the chest), grasp
the fact of Ocelot’s treachery and regain their presence of mind. The CMC
is already dead, a bullet hole in the brow. Gurlukovich’s men raise their
assault rifles, but Ocelot’s coat, still making its ballistic progress
through the air, is now blocking their view. Ocelot is on the move again
and, drawing another Single Action Army pistol from the back holster with
his left hand (the detonator in his right hand), he pulls the trigger
rapidly. The duster acquires more bullet holes.

Solider:
	(cry of pain)
Solider:

Solider:
	(cry of pain)
Solider:
	(cry of pain)
Solider:

etc...

Gurlukovich guards are cut down en masse behind the floating duster.
Several Marines also go down in the hail of bullets. The bullet-riddled
coat continues to turn and twist in the air even after the last body has
hit the floor. The Marines look on, stunned by the strange turn of events.
Ocelot spins his sidearm and returns it to the hip holster without
emptying the cylinder. He moves the transmitter from the stiffened right
hand to the left,, and at that action, the Marines regain some semblance
of composure and raise their weapons. However, the men are confused and
shaken by the loss of their leader.

Confused buzz of the Marines:

Marine:
	(a yowl of rage at the death of their Commandant and comrades)
Marine:
	Sir!
Marine:
	No!
Marine:
	(exclamation of shock)
Gurlukovich guard:
	(exclamation of shock)
Gurlukovich guard:
	Colonel - - !
Gurlukovich guard:
	What is this!
Gurlukovich guard:
	Why are you doing this!?
Etc...

Ocelot, he eyes glittering:

Ocelot:
	Show’s over! If you wish to live, I suggest you run now!
Ocelot:
	This ship is still in the Lower New York Harbor. You may yet make
	it to shore if you swim for your life!

Ocelot pushes the transmitter button without hesitation, and the tanker
rocks violently as the ear-shattering blast fills the holds. He quickly
climbs into Metal Gear, already in standby mode, and Snake, abandoning
his cover, starts to run towards RAY. The tanker’s holds ring with the
disjointed babble of shock, anger and the echoes of the explosion; and the
men are in a state of panic.

Soldiers in panic:

Gurlukovich guard:
	(scream)
Gurlukovich guard:
	Oh Crao!
Gurlukovich guard:
	He;s got Metal Gear!
Gurlukovich guard:
	Get him!
Gurlukovich guard:
	We’re sinking!
Marine:
	(scream)
Marine:
	The ship!
Marine:
	Open fire!
Marine:
	Abandon ship!!
Marine:
	Don’t let him get away!
Marine:
	We’re sinking!
Marine:
	No!
Marine:
	He has Metal Gear!
Etc.

The explosion blows several holes in the hull, and water begins to rush
in. Ocelot is climbing the ladder set into Metal Gear’s leg. Alarms go
off, and the Marine’s fire their weapons in unison. The water is rising
rapidly, and the rotating point of the emergency lighting flashes
continuously as the Gurlukovich guards who were on Metal Gear initiation
sequence are swept away by the incoming flood.

The cries of the Gurlukovich guards as they are swept away.

Gurlukovich guards:
	(screams as the water hits them)

Snake abandon’s his cover and runs out.

Snake:
	OCELOT!!

Ocelot reaches for Metal Gear’s controls with one hand. At the sound of a
well-remembered voice, his dead right hand twitches.

Ocelot:
	!?
Ocelot:
	Aaaarrghhhh!!

The dormant personality within him suddenly takes over. A momentary
flashback to Liquid’s image (flash-insert several frames from MGS1.)

Snake, blocking Metal Gear’s way, raises his USP. The image should double
with that of his previous confrontation with REX in the player’s minds.
The clenched knob of Ocelot’s right hand works itself loose, and Ocelot
slowly turns around.

Liquid:
	It’s been awhile, brother!

Ocelot’s personality is completely supplanted by that of Liquid Snake.
Even his body language is that of Liquid, not Ocelot.

Snake:
	(Confused) Who are you?
Liquid:
	You know who I am.

He clenches his right hand, a habit of Liquid’s. Liquid’s right hand is
controlling Ocelot’s mind and body. Snake recognizes both the gesture and
the speech, but cannot quite believe the evidence of his senses.

Snake:
	Liquid?

Ocelot narrows his eyes as he examines Snake’s appearance, almost
nostalgic.

Liquid:
	Not so young anymore, eh, SnakeYou’re drowning in time. I know
	what it’s like, brother.

Snake, reminded of the accelerated agin he has been experiencing recently,
has fallen silent.

Snake:
	...
Liquid:
	No wonder Naomi passed you over for the FOXDIE program.
Liquid:
	Arr!

Ocelot suddenly tries to grab his right hand with his left, as though it
is an organism in and of itself, out of his control.

Ocelot:
	(To his right hand) Out - - get out of my mind! Liquid

Snake looks on in confusion at Ocelot’s bizarre behavior. Ocelot bares
his teeth and savages his own hand, drawing blood. It is to no avail,
however, and the right hand once again suppresses its host personality.
Ocelot’s pupils are completely dilated. Liquid continues.

Liquid:
	The price of physical prodigy Few more years and you’ll be
	another dead clone of the old man.
Liquid:
	Our raw materials are vintage, brother. Big Boss was in his late
	50’s when they created his copies.
Liquid:
	But I, - - I live on, through this arm.
Snake:
	Liquid’s arm?

The two men face each other in the chaos. The hold is filling with water,
and the Marine’s and the Gurlukovich guards are attempting to escape,
oblivious to Snake and Ocelot.

The soldiers, trying to get out.

Marine:
	(scream)
Marine:
	The water’s rising!
Marine:
	Oh Shhh!
Marine:
	This way’s no good!
Marine:
	Go, get out!
Marine:
	We have to go up!
Marine:
	Get the lifeboats!
Gurlukovich guard:
	(scream)
Gurlukovich guard:
	We’re not going to last much longer!
Gurlukovich guard:
	Abandon ship
Gurlukovich guard:
	The traitor!
Gurlukovich guard:
	Colonel!
Gurlukovich guard:
	We’re going down!
etc...

Colonel Gurlukovich remains face down on the podium.

Gurlukovich:
	Olga... (choking sound)

The water rises, laps against and finally over the podium. Gurlukovich
gurgles out a last lungful of blood-laced air into the water. The swirl
of bright blood spreads through the tide as the swelling sea chokes the
life out of the immobilized Gurlukovich. The water continues to rise and
whirl, and the bodies of the Russian colonel and the Marine Corp
Commandant now lie submerged on the podium. Ocelot’s duster is swept away
by the current. Another explosion rattles the stricken tanker, and Snake
loses his balance. He falls into the water with a muffled grunt.

Snake:
	(swears indistinctly)
Liquid:
	Ah!

With a sharp grunt, Ocelot leaps into the cockpit. The is unbelievably
agile for a man in his 50’s (same move as in previous title). Ocelot
takes control of Metal Gear; standing in the cockpit, he is terribly like
Liquid.

Snake rises and looks up at RAY. Ocelot has put on a pilot’s headset and
placed an eye module used in attack helicopters over his right eye. He
rapidly locks the restraining belt in its place; the cockpit snaps closed
and Metal Gear RAY starts to move.

Liquid:
	You don’t have what it takes after all.
Liquid:
	(over the microphone) You’re going down, Snake - - with this
	tanker!

RAY bounds off its perch. The impact sends Snake and the others
scattering; a sheet of water hits Snake and he goes flying straight into
the hull.

Snake:
	(Groan)!

The RAY swings its head around as if to take in the sight of the men,
then lowers its snout into the water. The machine starts to drink deeply,
drawing the seawater into its system. Once it is saturated with water,
noticeable changes come over its body; the surface is now glistening with
energy. A tumorous, cylindrical growth emerges from its midsection and
underbelly, rotating steadily. Seawater starts to drain out from these
jutting cylinders like pus from a boil. The jaundiced waste water washes
over the Ray’s surface and the weapon takes on the look of a rejuvenated
slug. It stretches like a satisfied animal to unlock stabilizers on either
side; the slug is now a monstrous bird on the verge of flight. The
overlapping thrusters edging the stabilizers writhe about with a tonal
whistle.

Snake activates his Codec while moving away from the weapon.

Snake:
	Otacon, we have a problem...

RAY raises its head towards the ceiling and lets out a terrible howl.
While gas or vapor shoots from on the open beak: RAY’s shrill cry echoes
in the destroyed hold, and what little glass remains  shatters. Soldiers,
their eardrums lacerated, clutch their heads.

Soldiers stopping the ears.

Marine:
	(scream)
Gurlukovich guard:
	(scream)

Otacon:
	Snake?

The men scramble out of the activated Metal Gear’s way.

Soldiers, trying to escape.

Marine:
	Go!
Marine:
	Damn!
Marine:
	We have to go up!
Gurlukovich guard:
	(scream)
Gurlukovich guard:
	Metal Gear!
Gurlukovich guard:
	We have to get out of here!
Gurlukovich guard:
	What about the helicopters? Call the choppers back here!
Gurlukovich guard:
	Open the hatch!!
Etc...

RAY spews out a torrent of seawater. The fouled water, tinted a murky
yellow, bursts forth (in seemingly irradiated bundles) from RAY’s beak
and tears through the ceiling and the hull as though they are made of
tissue paper. The noise drowns out the screams and shouts of the men.
RAY’s second valley of radiation (seawater) arcs over the hull’s surface.
The hull gives way and the sea ruches in. When the water washes over the
(cone-shaped) tumor embedded in RAY’s tail section, the cone shoots out,
lengthening into a tail. RAY swings the surface of the water (to split it
momentarily, ala parting of the Red Sea)?Men go flying from the impact.

Men, as they go flying.

Marine:
	(scream)
Gurlukovich guard:
	(scream)
etc...

Snake is also bodily hurled into the water, and Otacon shouts untly.

Snake:
	(sharp grunt as he is launched into air)
Otacon:
	Snake!!

RAY lets out a howl of delight like an animal that finds itself back in
its element. It moves forward leisurely, crushing men with its feet and
tail as they desperately try to keep afloat. The water rises abruptly and
RAY beings to submerge rapidly.

To Scene T13a1D Metal Gear Escapes

SCENE T13a1D Metal Gear Escapes
Tanker holds, bow of the ship. In front of Metal Gear

The stern begins to sink as the ship’s huge and deadly cargo makes its
way from the bow to the stern. Snake manages to fight his way to the
water’s surface.

Snake:
	(shallow intake of breath)

RAY’s cockpit is now at the same level as Snake’s face. Ocelot stares at
Snake’s image on the monitor from his seat in the cockpit, then raises
Solidus on the radio.

Ocelot:
	No problems proceeding as planned, sir.

Falling debris from the ceiling forces Snake’s head under water once
again. He chokes as water rushes into his lungs, drowning him.

Snake:
	(retching cough)
Ocelot:
	...Yes, at the location we discussed

Waterlogged bodies of American and Russian soldiers drift across Snake’s
field of vision. RAY has shifted into its submarine configuration, and
speeds away from the sinking wreck. The tanker , along with Snake and its
other captives, continues the long progress down to the harbor’s bottom.

Ocelot:
	Yes, I have photographic evidence of Snake on the scene. The
CYPHER was most useful...

Metal Gear glides through the water, as efficient and graceful as its
namesake, the manta ray. It once again shifts shape, and in its new
high-speed configuration, accelerates in a single thrust of power.

Ocelot:
	I look forward to tomorrow’s news flash...
Ocelot:
	I would say that the Marine Corp’s plans are on infinite hold...
Ocelot:
	...Yes, of course, Mr. President.

RAY disappears into the darkness of the Atlantic Ocean.

P001_01_P01 Opening Infiltration 1, Polygon demo 1
Verrazano Bridge

April 29th, 2009
The sky is a deep, cloudless blue. Verrazano Bridge, their dark gray
bodies lit by the glare reflecting off the water’s surface. The bridge
has been sealed off, and military and police personnel mill about on the
bridge. Global Positioning Satellite data is relayed in real-time to the
numerous monitors. The scattering of bright points of light over the map
of the harbor area reveal the scope of the security forces at work
guarding the plant. Police officers follow the path of the choppers from
the bridge railing, Binoculars raised. A simple briefing audio consisting
of the Colonel’s voiceover starts.

Colonel:
	Snake, do you remember the sinking of that tanker 2 years ago?
Raiden:
	Of course.
Colonel:
	Terrorists blew a hole in an oil tanker full of crude barely 20
	miles off the shore of Manhattan - - your classic nightmare. It
	didn’t take long for the government to put an oil fence around
	the whole mess. And then that massive offshore cleanup facility
	went up inside.
Raiden:
	The Big Shell. I hear the cleanup isn’t quite over yet.
Colonel:
	It takes time. But in the meantime, the Shell’s become a landmark,
	a symbol of environmental protection.

Run Big Shell Background lines over the demo sequence to this point.

Team leader:
	Calling Teams Alpha and Bravo
Team leader:
	Deploy at the Big Shell as scheduled.

Sound bites from the SEAL team leader’s radio call

The choppers are flying low, almost skimming along the ocean surface.
Military and police crafts bob on the water near the bridge trestles,
blocking sea traffic into the harbor. The camera pans to take in the giant
offshore plant. The plant consists of two structures, hexagonal units
clustered on a north-south axis. An oval oil fence surrounds a patch of
the sea, with Shell One and Shell Two at the center.

Telop - - The Big Shell: Offshore Cleanup Facility

The structure lies on the ocean’s surface like a giant tortoise shell, or
to the more fanciful viewer, a hex-shaped area straight out of a sim game.
Raiden surfaces in a flurry of bubbles after the choppers pass overhead;
the elaborate scuba wear obscures his appearance entirely, save for a
trace of blonde hair. He would appear to be Snake to veteran players. In
Raiden’s mouth is a cylindrical oxygen module, and the plant and two
choppers reflect off a curious, scroll-like pair of goggles (which
completely cover his eyes). After ascertaining the direction of the
choppers’ flight, Raiden once again dives out of view.

Colonel:
	Approximately six hours ago, the Big Shell was seized by an armed
	group.
Raiden:
	Do we have an ID?
Colonel:
	Former members of the Navy SEAL’s special antiterrorist training
	squad, Dead Cell. Russian private army members may also be
	involved. It’s a highly-trained group, and they have the Big Shell
	under complete control.
Raiden:
	Who’s the leader?
Colonel:
	That we’ll discuss later.

Run terrorist briefing lines over the demo sequence up to this point.

The Big Shell

Aerial shot of the plant’s alien form. The chopper moves in close to the
structure. The Color (texture) of the ocean surface is obviously different
inside the fence. The oil slick covering the fenced-in water deadens the
surface to the point that there is almost no reflectivity. A man calls out
inside the chopper.

SEAL Alpha Zero:
	Come in from downwind, the pull up fast!
SEAL Alpha Zero:
	Get ready to fast rope down to Shell One!
SEAL Alpha Zero:
	Five minutes to ETA.
Team leader:
	(OFF) Alpha, your top priority is to rescue and safeguard the
	President!
Team leader:
	(OFF) team Bravo, watch out for Stillman’s back, and get those
	C4’s disarmed...

The chopper’s rotor whips the ocean’s surface (and the oil slick inside
the fence) into a frenzied wake. On the other side of the structure, the
other helicopter circles in a bid to distract the enemy.

Underwater, close to the Big Shell.

Raiden swims below the surface, infrared goggles activated. The
point-of-view shot is tinted red. In actuality, the infrared goggles POV
sequences are in black and white (white for high-temperature areas, black
for lower temperatures). Raiden cautiously approaches the oil fence. The
closer he gets to the fence, the lesser the amount of light penetrating
the ocean surface above. The fence is emblazoned with military warning
signs such as No entry, Danger - - High Voltage and No Entry Except
for Authorized Personnel. A Decontamination Facility sign is in view.
Raiden checks the fence; there are numerous dead fish along the fence.
A hole has been cut in the fence, large enough for a single person. There
are signs that the hole was made for infiltration purposes. Raiden slips
through the opening, taking care not to come into contact with the fence.

Raiden:
	What are their demands?
Colonel:
	Thirty Billion dollars.
Raiden:
	Thirty Billion dollars?  What makes them think they can get that
	much?
Colonel:
	There was a government-sponsored tour going on at the Big Shell
	that day.
Raiden:
	Hostages, huh?
Colonel:
	A VIP form one of the major conservation groups and one from our
	own government - - the Most Important Person in a sense.
Raiden:
	The most important person?
Colonel:
	James Johnson.
Raiden:
	The President!
Colonel:
	Unless the demands are met, the terrorists intend to blow the Big
	Shell out of the water.
Raiden:
	And the crude will ignite, turning Manhattan Harbor into an
	Inferno.
Colonel:
	That’s not the worst-case scenario. If the chlorides being used
	to decontaminate the seawater go up with the oil, toxins
	containing catastrophic levels of dioxins will be released.
Colonel:
	In other words, the bay’s ecosystem will be wiped out, and the
	sea will turn into a toxic soup for centuries - - becoming the
	worst environmental disaster in history.

Run Terrorist Demands lines over the demo sequence up to this point.

Underwater, near bottom of Strut A.

A number of dead fish also dot the inside of the fence. Raiden looks up
at the surface; the thick film of crude blocks out the sun entirely. To
the front are numerous lights affixed to the strut. Raiden turns off the
infrared vision. Tiny white precipitates drift down like Marine Snow from
the surface; brilliant in the beams of the spotlights. The shimmering
bands of light and particles are reminiscent of the Alaska sequences in
the previous game. Raiden moves over the ocean floor and locates the
plant’s barnacle-encrusted maintenance outlet. He climbs up the ladder
into the hatch.
	
Colonel:
	You have two mission objectives. One: Infiltrate the offshore
	decontamination facility  Big Shell and safeguard  the President
	and other hostages; and two: Disarm the terrorists by any means
	necessary.
Colonel:
	You should know that SEAL Team 10 is also conducting a rescue
	operation.
Raiden:
	Is this a joint effort?
Colonel:
	No, FOXHOUND remains a covert body. Don’t alert them to your
	presence  that’s an order.

Run Raiden Mission Briefing lines over the demo sequences up to this
point.

Inside the facility pool, bottom of Strut A

Raiden breaks the surface of the infiltration pool. A POV sweep of the
water’s surface reveals a glimpse of a figure in a diving suit, a possible
enemy. Raiden moves up the ladder with utmost caution; in the demo, the
climb is accomplished quickly and all at once. (In the game, the climb
would be accomplished interactively every time the player falls into the
pool). The C4’s attached to the side of the mini-submarine (placed there
by Fatman) move across the camera lens. Having cleared the ladder, Raiden
inclines his head and raises the Colonel on Codec in a manner similar to
the previous installment.

Codec screen

Raiden reaches the poolside and activates the Codec. The Codec screen
appears: In bot the right and left-hand windows are middle polygon cranial
models. Blinking and mouthing (mouthing tool) in sync with the lines.
Raiden’s head is wrapped in goggle gear reminiscent of the alien
Grays. In order to deceive those players who have completed the tanker
chapter into beleiveing that this chapter features the same hero - -
Snake - - the voice effects are modulated accordingly. The hero’s
appearance differs from Snake’s, but the deception will be continued
until he takes off the goggles.

Raiden:
	This is Snake. I am now inside Strut A of Shell One.
Colonel:
	How are things?
Raiden:
	We’re in luck, looks like there are no sentries posted here.
Colonel:
	What the visibility?
Raiden:
	The lights on the plant’s struts are functioning. I wont have to
	use the IR goggles.
Colonel:
	Any problems?
Raiden:
	There was a brand-new hole cute through the oil fence. There’s
	someone else besides me that wanted to get in badly.
Colonel:
	That’s not possible.
Raiden:
	What about SEAL Team 10?
Colonel:
	They landed on the roof of the Big Shell as planned. And by the
	way, Snake, we’re changing your code name for all following
	communications.
Raiden:
	What’s wrong with ‘Snake’?
Colonel:
	Just a precaution. You are now designated ‘Raiden’.

*If the user had cleared the Tanker Chapter.

Redundant training will be eliminated for users who have experienced the
Tanker Chapter. Since forcing a repeat of topics covered in the Tanker
Chapter would be unnecessarily dull, the idea is to make the users think
that the entire Tanker Chapter was a VR exercise. At this point, the hero
is still Snake.

Colonel:
	All right, Raiden, you’ve already covered infiltration in VR
	training.
Raiden:
	I’ve completed 300 missions in VR.
Raiden:
	I feel like some kind of legendary mercenary...

Continue using the code name from this point.

Colonel:
	Okay, we’ll skip that part.

*If the user has not yet cleared the Tanker Chapter.

Colonel:
	This will be your first sneaking mission.
Colonel:
	The arms will naturally have to be procured on-site.

For below, use lines identical to the previous installment.

Colonel:
	Make sure nobody sees you.
Colonel:
	If you need to, contact me by Codec. The frequency is 141.85.
Colonel:
	When you want to use the Codec, push the select button.
Colonel:
	When we need to reach you - - (revise to the line from the
	previous title) contact you, press the select button.
Colonel:
	When you hear that noise, press the select button
Colonel:
	The Codec’s receiver directly stimulates the small bones of your
	ear. No one but you will be able to hear it.
Raiden:
	All right. I’ll contact you if anything changes.
Colonel:
	Fist, make you way to the upper section of the Big Shell.
Raiden:
	How do I get up to the next level?

The game clip of the elevator appears on the Codec screen. Forward to
image of Raiden looking up at the elevator and a point of view shot of the
elevator. More images, both of the elevator’s location and indication of
its function.

Colonel:
	There’s an elevator at the far end of that area. Use that.
Raiden:
	Sounds good.

Colonel:
	It is referred to as ‘Smart Skin’ in military R+D. Data about
	damage  to different regions of the body, including blood loss,
	is exchanged between the suit and the intravenous nanomachines to
	create a feedback system.
Raiden:
	There’s a lot of pressure on my torso.
Colonel:
	Relax. The suit applies varying pressure to major internal organs
	to maximize performance and safeguard their functions.

P002_01_S01 Strut A junction Hatch 1, Scenario Demo 1
Entrance level pool, Strut A

Raiden finds the watertight hatch into the elevator area and opens it. On
the other side is an L-shaped corridor leading into the elevator hall.
Raiden takes a closer look. (Teach the players how to use Look function
and the right analog stuck in the Pad Demo) the section of the corridor
within the field of vision is no more than 30ft in length, and the rest
turns off to the right. Raiden takes a step, then, sensing someone nearby,
freezes. At the far end of the corridor (in front of the sliding door to
the elevator gall), a sentry soldier flashes a ? to indicate his state
of mind. The man is a Gurlukovich militiaman, outfitted with an Abakan
AN-94 assault rifle, a Makarov pistol, tiger stripe camos and a skull cap
(no backpack). He takes his radio off his hip and tries to reach the
others, but the crackling static (sound effect) forces him to give up.
Raiden conceals himself behind the hatch door and brushes the back of his
neck to activate his own Codec’s SEND.

Inside the Codec screen, binocular framed images (movie) appears. Zoom

Raiden:
	An AN-94 and a Makalov

The rifle muzzle is quipped with a curious, gourd-like attachment - -
the camera closes in on the muzzle compensator, one of the Abakan assault
rifle’s most recognizable characteristics. The binoculars pan down to
frame the grenades clipped to the belt.

Raiden:
	Those grenades all his equipment is Russian made.
Colonel:
	Must be a Gurlukovich man.
Raiden:
	Gurlukovich?
Colonel:
	A Russian private Army that was in line to work with the Shadow
	Moses takeover group, four years ago.
Raiden:
	What’s their stake in this one?
Colonel:
	The must have made a deal - - an arrangement with the terrorists.
Colonel:
	They’ve become a band of mercenaries, an army without a country.
Colonel:
	A sentry would normally call in reinforcements at the sight of
	you, but he can’t do that in that area you’re in now.
Colonel:
	The supplementary radio antenna in the walls are completely
	corroded. Radio communication is effectively impossible inside
	that area.
Raiden:
	What about our communication system.
Colonel:
	No effect on nanomachine supported networks, only on ordinary
	radio transmissions. But even if they’re cut off from each other,
	the enemy is armed. Exercise extreme caution, Raiden.

P003_01_P01 Snake’s elevator ride 1, Polygon Demo 1 (MC)
Elevator hall

Raiden enters the elevator hall. Unlike the entrance level pool, the area
is lit. Straight ahead, the elevator had just started its ascent. The
Russian sentry from a few minutes ago is ejected from the rising cage
(courtesy  of Snake’s roundhouse kick). The sentry crumples to the floor,
out cold. His cap is marked with a star. Raiden takes stock of the
situation: 2 more men lying in conscious in the elevator hall, both
wearing similarly-marked headgear. Raiden stares after the ascending
elevator, and catches a glimpse of a figure in an out modeled sneaking
suit (Snake is not yet dressed in a flight suit). The strangers back is
turned to the camera and Raiden ‘s gaze. Snake has made his own
infiltration form this point a few minutes ago. Unfortunately, several
sea lice have made their way into his equipment during that time (the
lice manage to make an appearance when Raiden first comes face to face
with Snake, contributing to the former’s distrust). This scene should be
reminiscent of the loading dock sequence from the beginning of the
previous title. The elevator has risen from our view, Raiden sinks to
one knee to commence Codec call.

Raiden:
	Colonel, there’s definitely another intruder in there beside me.
Colonel:
	That’s not a possibility.
Raiden:
	Not a team - - looks like a solo job.
Colonel:
	One man...? (Sinks with thought)
Raiden:
	We may not know who he is, but he managed to take care of every
	sentry in the area; they’re all out cold. Whoever he is, he’s got
	some skills. (A strong hint at Snake)
Colonel:
	We need you to get an ID But for now, you can take advantage of
	the situation and get to work.
Colonel:
	There’s a terminal in front of the elevator, a node.
Raiden:
	Did you say nerd?
Colonel:
	Not ‘nerd’ - - node.
Raiden:
	Oh.
Colonel:
	Use the node to gain access to the Big Shell’s facilities network.
Raiden:
	Then what?
Colonel:
	Pull up that map of the structure; that’ll let you activate the
	Soliton Radar.
Raiden:
	The Soliton Radar.

For users who completed the Tanker Chapter

Colonel:
	True, that radar came in useful during the VR training.

For users who did not complete the Tanker Chapter

Colonel:
	A radar system - - uses biological magnetic fields as input.
Colonel:
	These estimated enemy positions are projected onto a map according
	to reference points collected via GPS signals and field personnel.
Colonel:
	We need to get to the map through the Big Shell’s node to put this
	data processing to practical use.
Colonel:
	The node unit is about three feet high - - should be colored blue.
	Each area has at least one, usually built right into the wall.

The game screen image appears on the Codec screen; the user can see where
the node is positioned.

Raiden:
	How do I gain access?
Colonel:
	Just push the Action button in front of the node.

The Codec screen now shows a visual representation of the node usage.

Colonel:
	The nanomachines in your body will take care of the security
	clearance, and allow you to access the node.
Colonel:
	Complete the procedure before those sentries gain consciousness.
Colonel:
	If they spot you,  you won’t be able to gain access for a while.
Colonel:
	Stay on guard
Raiden:
	Got it.

P004_01_P01 First access to the node 1 Polygon Demo 1 (MC)
Near the node

Raiden spots the node and holds his palm out. The nanomachines inside his
body begin to respond, and ribbons of plasma spew out (use the effect
from the tanker landing). Raiden’s hair stands on end as the access
message appears on the node terminal screen.

Codec screen

Raiden successfully gains network access. The Colonel raises him on the
Codec.

Colonel:
	Good work, Raiden.
Raiden:
	The radar should be functioned now?

For users who completed the Tanker Chapter.

Colonel:
	Remember your VR training sessions.
Colonel:
	The tool is exactly the same one - - it maps the terrain as well
	as the position of the enemy personnel.

For users who didn’t complete the Tanker Chapter.

Colonel:
	Let me explain about your Soliton Radar system.

The view changes to the game screen, with the radar screen displayed - -
it could also be the radar primer vocals from the previous game displayed
within the Codec screen. The screen shows the game view.

Colonel:
	The bright dot in the middle is you, Snake. The red dots are your
enemies and the blue cone shape represents their FOV.

At this time no blue cones are in sight since the enemies are unconscious.

Colonel:
	Snake, your radar isn’t affected by the weather, but if you’re
	discovered by an enemy you won’t be able to use it.
Colonel:
	It gets jammed rather easily I’m afraid.
Colonel:
	It’s all made from currently existing technology. You won’t be
	able to use it in an area with strong harmonic resonance. So be
	careful.
Colonel:
	The Big Shell’s layout map should now be available after touching
	the start button.
Raiden:
	How do I save mission data?
Colonel:
	I’ve set aside a proprietary frequency fro saves. And an analyst
	to work on the data too.

Rose interrupts:

Rose:
	Jack - - is everything all right?

Rose replaces(almost a morph effect) the Colonel in the window. (lot of
static)
She wears a beige suit with a blouse, revealingly unbuttoned. A pair of
earings and traces of makeup complete the somewhat unreal effect.

Raiden:
	What are you doing here!?
Rose:
	Jack, can you hear me?
Raiden:
	Rose! You’re not supposed to be involved!
Raiden:
	What’s going on!?
Rose:
	Jack, I’m a part of the mission.
Raiden:
	Colonel, what the hell is going on?
Colonel:
	Raiden meet the mission analyst. She’ll be overseeing the data
	saving and support.
Raiden:
	Why her?
Colonel:
	The FOXHOUND analyst that wa supposed to take part in this
	mission was in an accident. Rosemary was brought in as a
	replacement.
Raiden:
	An accident...?
Colonel:
	And according to the files, she knows you better than anybody
	else.
Raiden:
	Rose may be in the service, but an intelligence analyst is no
	field officer.
Colonel:
	Not to worry. She has our technical staff at her disposal.
Raiden:
	She’s never been a part of a field mission. This is insane.
Colonel:
	I have my own reason for selecting her for this mission, soldier.
Raiden:	
	Colonel, I fail to see - -
Colonel:
	I know your VR training performance in an out. But sometimes
	that’s not enough. You’re familiar with the Shadow Moses Incident>
Raiden:
	You know I covered it in VR.
Colonel:
	If there’s a crucial tactical detail that case taught us, it was
	the power of the operatives will to survive.
Raiden:
	I was trained to fight. My personal feelings have no place in a
	mission.
Colonel:
	We’ve learned that it doesn’t work that way. And in the field,
	you need all the help you can get.
Rose:
	Jack? You’re stuck with me whether you like it ornot.
Raiden:
	Rose
Rose:
	Your need someone to watch your back. But-
Rose:
	(with sudden steeliness) I have conditions that need to be met,
	Colonel.
Colonel:
	What is it?
Rose:
	I’ll perform my duties and save that mission data.
Rose:
	But I’m aware that technically, I’m not part of the mission
	control team.
Rose:
	After all, I’m just a normal girl who’s worried about Jack.
Rose:
	But that means Colonel, that I am not required to follow your
	orders outside of my immediate duties.
Rose:
	Jack is not simply a field personnel for me to track.
Rose:
	His safety comes first to me, not ht emission.
Rose:
	And because of that, I will be monitoring, and keeping a record of
	every communication you have with him, Colonel.
Colonel:
	...Given the circumstances, you’re free to do what you see fit.
Rose:
	(to Raiden) Hey, I prefer this to being kept in the dark, waiting.
Colonel:
	I’d like to make a request, if I may.
Rose:
	 Of course.
Colonel:
	His handle is Raiden. For the duration of the mission, could you
	call him that?
Rose:
	Yes sir.
Rose:
	All right - - Raiden. (slightly awkwardly)
Rose:
	Let me know when you’re ready to turn in a save.
Rose:
	(Cool, businesslike) The proprietary save frequency is 140.96.

The Codec automatically switches to 140.96.

Rose:
	(Softly) I just switched frequencies.
Rose:
	Jack? (slightly lowered voice / thinks she’s out of the Colonel’s
	earshot)
Raiden:
	What?
Rose:
	(intimately) Do you know what day it is tomorrow?
Raiden:
	April 30th - - is there something special about it?
	(the day he and Rose met)
Rose:
	Isn’t there?
Raiden:
	I can’t remember. I’m sorry.
Rose:
	Oh well, I’ll keep trying ‘till I hear the answer.
Rose:
	I’m going to let you go now, Jack. Take care.

P005_01_P01 Raiden elevator ascent 1 Polygon Demo 1 (MC)
The elevator, bottom of Strut A

Raiden enters the elevator, and the see-through cage comes to life. A
sequence of cuts that mirror those from the precious title: a metal forest
of girders and supports falls out of view at high speed. Roll main staff
credits, again in a manner similar to the previous title. The briefing
exchange with the Colonel echoes over the scene.
Raiden is shedding his diving gear; the goggles obscuring his face come
off. A longish mane of hair tumbles our and hides his face again. The
elevator clears the water and a stunning Playstation 2-driven panorama
comes into focus. The Manhattan island can be seen to the distance, over
an expanse of shimmering water. The clear, sunlight day cannot offer a
more radical contrast to the Tanker Chapter. Raiden tosses his head in an
almost feminine gesture to swing his hair out of the way. Slo-mo and
using the hair physics model to the best advantage. Behind him, seagulls
wheel with unforced elegance. His fine-boned, somewhat androgynous
features visible to the camera at last. Raiden raises his face, echoing
Snake in the title scenes of MGS1. The elevator comes to a halt at the
top opf the offshore plant. Display the title MGS2. High impact sound
effect.

Colonel:
	The name of their leader is Solid Snake.
Raiden:
	The hero of Shadow Moses!? So that’s why you changed my codename.
Colonel:
	Right. But it can’t be THE Solid Snake. He died two years ago, on

Raiden:

shapes. Raiden takes in the area.

Sunny, clear skies. The drone of the SEAL team’s choppers can be heard,
but they are nowehere in sight. Raiden walks over to the closest cover,

Colonel:
	Raiden, SEAL team 10 is in.
Raiden:
	Do we really have no line of communication with the SEAL’s?
Colonel:
	They don’t know anything about us. You know we work in the dark,
	and this mission is no exception. Only a few people know about
	your presence here.
Raiden:
	
Colonel:
	There’s no need for concern. This operation is under the
	Pentagon’s direct Command, and the NSDD (National Security

P010_01_P01 encounter with the Vamp 1 Polygon Demo 1 (MC)
Straight Corridor, BC connecting bridge

Raiden hurries towards Strut B after hearing the intercepted SEALs
communication. He reaches the straight corridor that leads to the connecting
bridge between Struts B and C. To the right is the door into the electrical
control room, and the body of a Navy SEAL (Body 2) lies in front of it. The
man has been slashed apart, and the walls and the floor are literally
splattered with blood. A trail of blood indicates the body has been dragged
some ways. The scene is reminiscent of the ‘carnage corridor’ scene in the
previous title. A smell like iron is in the air.
Raiden moves down the corridor with care (if he has a gun/M9 in possession,
have him hold it).

Inside the electrical control room, Strut B

Change scene (inside the electrical control room)
Inside the electrical control room, a SEAL fires blindly (Body 3) about him,
wild with terror. Every light fixture in the room has already been destroyed,
and only daylight filtering in through a narrow slit of skylight gives a
degree of visibility to the surroundings. A flash of the M4 fire illuminates
the room.

The SEALs (body 4) keep up a running commentary as they vainly struggle
against an invisibly enemy.

Seal Alpha Zero:
        Damn!
Seal Alpha One:
        Fire!
Seal Alpha Two!
        I can’t hit him!
Seal Alpha Three:

Seal Alpha Zero:
        Aaaargh!! (dying scream)

radios:

Squad Leader:
        Alpha Zero, come in Alpha Zero!

Corridor in front of the electrical control room, Strut B.
Change scene (inside the electrical control room)
The gunfire can be heard in the corridor. Raiden approaches the door with
caution.

Inside the electrical control room

The shadowy figure of Vamp flits through the air mockingly, easily evading
the SEL team’s fire. Vamp kicks and propels himself off of transformers,
walls and ceiling with great speed and superhuman gravity-defying agility.
The flapping black (dark olive drab) coat gives the figure a bat-like
appearance. The SEAL’s bullets miss their target with stark consistency.
Their enemy lands on the ground, and with the grace of a ballet dancer, does
a deadly pirouette that cuts the SEAL’s arms into ribbons.

SEAL Alpha 0:
        (Scream. Long-short pattern)
SEAL Alpha 1:
        (Scream. Long-short pattern)

Vamp aims with lethal accuracy for the men’s jugulars. Blood spurts up to the
ceiling, and the M4’s clatter to the floor. Vamp finishes up by slitting
their throats. Sprays of blood cloud the shaft of sunlight, and the soldiers
screams reverberate through the room. Vamp nimbly avoids the showers of blood
while the Alpha team’s lifeless bodies thud to the floor.

Squad Leader:
        All Alpha, come in!
Squad Leader:
        What’s going on? Alpha, respond!

There is nobody left to respond to his call.

Raiden takes a deep breath in front of the door, then dashes inside.

Inside the electrical control room, Strut B
Change scene (Inside the electrical control room, Strut B)

The small room is filled with smoke from all the gunfire, severely limiting
visibility. A shaft of sun from the skylight gives the place an oddly solemn,
church-like air. On the floor is a scattering of cartridges from the SEAL’s
M4’s, and the walls and transformers are marked with bullet holes. The damage
from the gunfire has shorted out the machines and the whole scene suggests a
vain struggle against some gigantic creature. Fresh blood coats the walls and
the floor, and bodies that had been Navy SEAL commandos until moments ago lie
under foot. The extensive wounds, apparent even on their limbs, and the
general state of the room point to a cause of death more gory than a common
gun shot. The room has seemingly bee transformed into a butcher shop.
At the far end of the room is an open locker (behind this door is the C4).
Two transformer units in the middle of the floor dominate the chamber. There
are stairs leading down to the lower level on either side.
Suddenly, a slurping sound breaks the silence.

Vamp:
        (sucking blood)

Raiden proceeds deeper into the room, cautiously. He can now see that the
Northeast staircase ends only one step down. Vamp stands there with his teeth
in a SEAL’s neck, drinking his blood. The man is already limp, held against
the wall by his killer; because of Vamp’s extreme height, the hapless SEAL’s
feet jerk and twitch in midair. Vamp hears Raiden approaching and releases
his hand. His victim crumples to the floor like a broken marionette. Vamp
slowly licks the blood off his lips with an inhumanly long tongue, then bares
his fangs (overdeveloped canines) in a snarl.

Vamp:
        (hisses aggressively)

His breath is white, though the room is not particularly cold. The idea is
that since Vamp came back from the dead at one point, he has abnormally low
body temperature. He wears black shades to cover his eyes, and the holster he
wears over his coat gives him a bat-like silhouette. Raiden aims his gun (if
he does not yet have one, he takes a fighting stance). The nightmarish
specter before him has Raiden unsettled and unsure; the surrealism of the
situation has momentarily deprived him of decisiveness. Raiden’s features are
reflected on his foe’s shades.

Raiden:
        !!

The man smiles. He snakes out his long tongue again, this time to lick at the
blood coating his moustache.

Raiden:
        What are you? (Shades of Snake’s first encounter with the ninja in the
        previous title)

Vamp carefully unsheathes a large knife and cuts into his bare chest, already
with similar marks. Blood runs out of the newly-made wound, staining the
dense patch of chest hair.

Raiden:
        !?

Raiden looks on with bewilderment as the man makes four more cuts in his
chest. There are other, older marks, all over his arms and stomach. The scars
are almost tattoo-like.

Vamp:
        Five today...

He exhales mistily every time he opens his mouth.

Vamp:
        Or rather, six?

He completes the though by taking an acrobatic leap (mid-air turn). With a
dancer’s precision, he manages to get behind Raiden’s back, the FOXHOUND
stands dazed, still shocked by the strange turn of events.

Man (Pliskin):
        Get down!!

A man’s voice rings out from the direction of the door (north). Raiden hits
the floor immediately, and several gunshots ring out. Visibility is
momentarily down due to the smoke. Raiden raises his face and scans the room,
but Vamp is nowhere to by seen. A man with an M4 cautiously enters the room.
He wears a SEAL uniform, the sleeves rolled up to the shoulders, and his
features are covered with a ski mask, save for the piercing eyes. On his head
is a large pair of radio headphones (the kind squad leaders carry).

Man (Pliskin):
        Where is he!

He demands an answer from Raiden, the latter still on the floor. As the
masked man moves slowly forward, M4 aimed, his boots make unpleasant sucking
noises on the blood-covered floor. Cut to the figure of Vamp clinging to the
ceiling. He noiselessly drops down, knife flashing like a living thing over
the SEAL’s arm. Blood spurts out from multiple wounds on the man’s limb, and
the gun (M4) clatters to the floor as it falls to his knees.

Man (Pliskin):
        Agh!

He crawls across the floor, nursing the arm, but the Vamp lifts him up by the
neck with one hand. The monster shoves its prey against the wall, easily, and
studies him wit detached curiosity. Raiden aims his weapon, but cannot get a
clear shot with the SEAL in the way. If Raiden does not own a weapon, he will
pick up the other man’s M4.

Man (Pliskin):
        Urgh...!

Vamp:
        Hmmm? Strange smell...

White exhalation swirls across the captive’s face. Vamp jerks away from the
man, and the prey falls to the floor. Vamp peers down at the SEAL over his
sunglasses. Through the mask’s eyeholes, he can see a pair of piercing eyes.

Vamp:
        You smell like -- !

Vamp knows Solidus’ scent, and knows equally that this cannot be Solidus.
Hence

Vamp:
        Are you -- it has to be!

He realizes that this is none other than Solid Snake, the Dead Cell’s sworn
enemy.

The recent captive rolls across the floor, clutching his bruised throat. He
manages a cry.

Man (Pliskin):
        Shoot him! What are you waiting for!
Raiden:
        !

Roused, Raiden pulls the trigger. Vamp launches into a pirouette again. For
some reason, Raiden cannot draw blood from him, even after firing an entire
clip at him. Raiden casts aside the spent magazine.
A message from Fortune crackles into Vamp’s radio (inside his ear), and he
comes to a halt. A woman’s voice can faintly be heard from the ‘phone’.

Fortune:
        Vamp --
Vamp:
        Yeah, Queen?
Fortune:
        Are you all done cleaning up?
Vamp:
        Yeah, but wait till I tell you what I found... (discovering Snake)
Fortune:
        Something interesting?
Vamp:
        I’ll tell you in person. Where are you?
Fortune:
        In the central unit, with the President.
Vamp:
        Be right there.

As Raiden finishes reloading his weapon amidst the gunsmoke, he hears Vamp
cry out strangely.

Vamp:
        (weird cry)

Vamp has disappeared.
F.O. / F.I.

Raiden regains his composure and turns the gun on the wounded man.

Man (Pliskin):
        Hold on, I’m not an enemy. Calm down.

Raiden’s aim remains unwavering.

Man (Pliskin):
        My name is S...

He (Pliskin) is about to state his name, then checks himself and searches
around for a false one.

Man (Pliskin):
        Pliskin. Iroquois Pliskin. Lieutenant Junior Grade.

Raiden does not answer. The man pulls off his balaclava with one hand to
reveal a head of blonde hair and the face of a man in his 50’s. His face is
stubbled; there is no bandana is sight. His appearance approximates that of
Liquid Snake in the last title. Raiden continues to stare him down.

Raiden:
        Are you a Navy SEAL?

Pliskin does not answer.

Pliskin:
        ...
Raiden:
        How did you get in?
Pliskin:
        Fast rope descent, from a Navy chopper.

He looks Raiden over carefully, his reply indifferent and distracted. The sea
lice previously seen at the entrance level pool chooses this moment to crawl
out of Pliskin’s gear. Raiden stares at he bugs, his suspicions mounting.

Raiden:
        Have I seen you before?

Because of his resemblance to Snake/Solidus, Raiden finds Pliskin vaguely
familiar.

Pliskin:
        That suit -- are you FOXHOUND?
Raiden:
        ... That’s right.

Raiden concedes reluctantly.

Pliskin:
        FOXHOUND was disbanded. (decisively)
Raiden:
        ...?
Pliskin:
        Where were you before FOXHOUND? Delta Force?

Raiden:
        NO -- not really. (Lie)
Pliskin:
        So this is your first?
Raiden:
        I’ve had extensive training -- the kind that’s indistinguishable
        from the real thing.

Snake’s VR missions.

Pliskin:

Raiden:
        (indignant) But realistic in every way.
Pliskin:
        A virtual grunt of the digital age. That’s just great.
Raiden:
        That’s far more effective that live exercises.
Pliskin:
        You don’t get injured in VR, do you? Every year a few soldiers die in
        field exercises.

Edit in a game screen of Snake being shot by enemy soldiers during VR training.

Raiden:
        (defending himself) There’s a pain sensation in VR, and even a sense
        of reality and urgency. The only difference is that it isn’t actually
        happening.
Pliskin:
        That’s the way they want you to think, to remove you from the fear
        that goes with battle situations.
Pliskin:
        War as a videogame -- what better way to raise the ultimate soldier.

Raiden:
        So you’re saying that VR training is some kind of mind control.

Raiden is needlessly aggressive; he feels that his qualifications as a
soldier have been belittled by Pliskin. At that moment, the Colonel checks in
on the Codec. Raiden takes the call, back turned towards Pliskin. Pliskin
cannot hear the dialogue since communication between the Colonel and Raiden
is a silent, nanotech-based exchange.

Colonel:
        (OFF) Raiden ? What’s going on!
Raiden:
        The Alpha team from Navy SEAL 10 is dead -- (remembering Pliskin), no

Raiden:

Raiden:
        What?
Colonel:
        This is a top-secret mission. No one can know that we're involved.

Raiden ends the call. In the meantime, Pliskin has gathered his gear and
walked over to the node to the southwest. The arm wounds from Vamp’s attack
have been bandaged. Pliskin is looking at the body lying in front of the
node. It is a Navy colonel. Raiden walks up to Pliskin.

Raiden:
        What's up?
Pliskin:
        Take a look.

Pliskin points to the dead colonel's right wrist.  A broken handcuff, the
lock damaged, dangles from it as though whatever was on the other cuff was
removed. The Black Case (aka the Football), containing the nuclear launch
sequence, had in fact been tethered to the man, but Raiden does not realize
that.

Raiden:
        What the hell...?
Pliskin:
        A Navy Colonel... (he realizes what the man must have been carrying)
Pliskin:
        Aghh...

Pliskin sits down on a stair dizzy and pale with blood loss.

Raiden:
        You all right?
Pliskin:
        Give me a few minutes. Must have lost a few more pints than I thought.

He takes out a cigarette, but cannot find his lighter.

Introduction of the Dead Cell members (silhouette/Shinkawa illustration). Edit
the illustrations and game data into a movie as in the previous title (TGS
movie). Individual character models not yet shown.

Pliskin:
        The name was originally intended to effect its anti-terrorist
        functions. The unit would launch unannounced assaults on government
        complexes, for the ultimate terrorism simulation. They were needed to
        show VR troopers like you how to deal with the real thing.
Pliskin:
        But around the time their original leader (Fortune's husband) died in
        prison, the unit began to unravel.
Pliskin:
        They were always close to the edge, but they became more and more
        extreme; began to go after U.S. allies, even civilians. We estimate no
        fewer than one hundred people died as a result of ‘accidents’ the Dead
        Cell arranged on their own. They were out of control  and it all came
        to a head six months ago.
Raiden:
        What happened?

Pliskin does not answer.

Images of Dead Cell members stumbling around on a battlefield. Vamp carries a
wounded in his arms. The deaths of Chinaman and the Old Boy.

Pliskin:
        The unit was devastated. There are only three left now—and you just
        saw one of them.
Raiden:
        Why would they go after the Big Shell?
Pliskin:
        How should I know? I told you they were on the lunatic fringe.
Raiden:
        What about the leader? He says he’s Solid Snake?

Pliskin reacts immediately to the name ‘Snake’. His voice suddenly becomes
formal, as though preparing for a speech.

        place?
Pliskin:
        Right. And he was the one that sank that tanker.
Raiden:
        But he’s a legend--
Pliskin:
        Legends are usually bad news. There’s not a lot of difference between
        heroes and madmen...
Raiden:
        You’re saying Snake is still alive and pulled another one?
Pliskin:
        No, he’s not involved in this one. His body was positively ID’d two
        years ago.
Raiden:
        Snake is dead...
Pliskin:
        And buried.

for Snake, and he had wanted to meet him in person someday.

Raiden:
        Pretty heavily armed for a bunch of bodyguards.
Pliskin:
        They were officially Secret Service. But it would have been more
        Accurate to say they were President Sears’ personal army.
Raiden:

Rose:
        (Disappointed) that’s okay.
Raiden:
        What is it, Rose? Talk to me.
Rose:
        I’d rather you figure it out. It’s important.
Raiden:
        How important?
Rose:
        Important enough. And we’ll talk about it, tomorrow.
Raiden:

Rose:

        as an analyst.
Rose:
        What is it?
Raiden:
        It has to do with Solid Snake. The leader of this takeover is
        claiming that he’s Snake himself.
Rose:

Raiden:
        I need as much data on him as possible. Everything they have on him
        after the Shadow Moses incident.
Rose:
        He’s dead now, isn’t he?
Raiden:
        Yes. Should be a burial record somewhere too.
Raiden:
        You should be able to request top-level security clearance from the

P012_01_P01 Fortune encounter 1 polygon demo 1 (MC)
BC connecting bridge

Raiden arrives at the connecting bridge between struts B and C, only to find
the Bravo team engaged in a firefight with someone. The SEAL’s are firing
continuously from the BC connecting path to a hidden target on the bridge
running between the BC section and the central area. The weapons in use here
are SOCOM’s or M4’s.
Raiden pulls out his gun and moves forward on full alert. As he passes the
large column that was blocking his view, an incredible sight greets his eyes.

The unseen foe is a queenly, slender woman, carrying a linear rifle almost
equal in length to her own height. Around her shoulder is draped a leather
coat as black as her skin; the hem flutters lazily in the sea breeze. A
sidearm (M() rests on her hip, and at her feet are the president
(unconscious) and the black case. She seems to have no interest whatsoever
in engaging the soldiers.
The SEAL team fires on the woman, but the bullets fail to find their target.
The woman carries with her a visible aura, like a pale fire (electromagnetic
pulse). The bullets curve away from Fortune as they close in. Raiden watches
the whole scene unfold from the shadows.

Raiden:
        What the hell is that?

A flock of gulls cluster around the woman, reinforcing the illusion of peace
and normalcy.

Fortune:
        Come, put me out of my misery!
SEAL Bravo Zero:
        This is impossible! Nothing will hit her!
SEAL Bravo One:
        Is she the one they call Fortune

Vamp bounds out of the central core, picks up the President like a rag doll
and slings him over his shoulder. Hooking the Black Case up in one hand, he
turns to Fortune.

Vamp:
        Queen.

Fortune nods in affirmation, and Vamp runs off weightlessly into the central
core area.

SEAL Bravo One:
        Don’t let them take the President!

Two backup members of the Alpha team (SEAL’s) come running out of Strut C.
They look at Raiden for a moment, then continue onto the BC connecting
bridge. Two of the Bravo men clatter onto the central area, toward the woman.

SEAL Bravo Zero:
        Ready grenades!

He fires a grenade from the launcher built into his M4. It flies straight
for the target, but comes to a halt in midair right in front of the woman,
then drops to the ground. It fails to detonate.

SEAL Bravo Three:
        A dud!?

The SEAL’s in the rear move in closer. The woman wearily raises her face, as
though surrendering to an inevitable inconvenience.

Fortune:
        Today is another bad day...

She swings the long linear rifle up to her hip, scattering the seabirds
about her into the air. The ocean breeze lefts her long, tightly curled
hair, and the SEAL’s terror-stricken visages glance off the twin mirrors of
her sunglasses.

Fortune:
        Is there anyone here that can give me happiness?
SEAL Bravo Zero:
        (a scream of despair at the coming death)

The woman pulls the trigger. The Bravo team disintegrates with every whine
of the linear rifle.

SEAL Bravo Zero:
        (scream)!
SEAL Bravo One:
        (scream)!
SEAL Bravo Two:
        (scream)!
SEAL Bravo Three:
        (scream)!

The linear rifle fires with a shattering sonic boom. There are no cartridges
to be ejected since the gun is caseless. Fortune continues to pull the
trigger until the roof of the Shell resembles a crash scene. The stair area
where the Bravo team made its final stand has been honeycombed by the fire
(the rounds cut through the metal with ease, and the bridge is tilted from
the stress. A few coils of the BC bridge support wires sway in mid-air,
sheared off in the middle. The men who were bringing up the rear slide
uncontrollably down the destroyed bridge to their death.

SEAL Bravo Zero:
        (Desperate scream)!
SEAL Bravo One:
        (Desperate scream)!
SEAL Bravo Two:
        (Desperate scream)!
SEAL Bravo Three:
        (Desperate scream)!

The bridge breaks off a few inches from where the woman stands, cutting
Raiden off from the central core. Not a single body remains on the roof. The
seabirds continue to fly about over Fortune.

Fortune:
        I’m so sorry, my beauties (note: since the gulls are doomed)... I’ll
        see you again someday.

Fortune turns and walks away (end of battle). Death comes for the birds at
the same moment, and their bodies begin a long drop toward the water.
Fortune continues her progress down what remains of the walkway into the
central core. A slow, dreamlike sway of her slender hips as she hums
sorrowfully (the ending theme). Raiden reports what he has just seen to
the Colonel.

Raiden:
        What?
Colonel:
        Besides, since the SEALs drew their fire, your infiltration went off
        without a hitch. On top of that, we know their defensive
        capabilities.
Raiden:
       Are you saying that this was all a feint?

        now, do you understand.
Raiden:

        There’s no time for questions. They could decide to retaliate for
        that failed assault.
Raiden:
        You mean the hostages?
Colonel:
        They could be in danger, yes. But we need to consider the possibility
        that they’ll blow the whole Shell. If that toxic spill does take
        place, it’ll devastate not only the harbor, but poison the coastline
        for generations.
Raiden:
        ...
Colonel:
        Raiden, we’ve had to adjust the mission objectives. The priority is
        now on removing those C4’s that the terrorists wired over the Big
        Shell. The President can wait, but this can’t.
Raiden:
        Colonel, you know I’m no bomb disposal expert.
Colonel:
        That’s not a problem  the Bravo team brought an explosives pro in
        with them. He was supposed to stand by on Strut C according to their
        mission plan. You should find him there.
Raiden:
        Is this according to simulation too...?
Colonel:
        What are you talking about? Get to Strut C and find him!
Raiden:
        Understood... But I need to ask you something before I go.
Colonel:
        Make it quick.
Raiden:
        Who are they - Dead Cell, I mean?
Raiden:
        (murmurs) They couldn’t hit her, no matter how hard they tried...
Raiden:
        And that vampire too. It’s like - (at a loss for words)
Raiden:
        It’s like being in a nightmare you can’t wake up from.
Rose:
        Jack, snap out of it!
Raiden:
        And you Rose - I can’t believe you’re on this mission. I keep
        thinking, I’ll wake up.
Colonel:
        Raiden, this is real. And that’s why you won’t wake up.
Raiden:
        But nothing seems real.
Rose:
        I’ve made up my mind to stay with you. Whether this is real or a bad
        dream. I’ll keep watching you till it’s over.
Raiden:
        Thank you, Rose. And I won’t let you be just a dream...(subplot)
Colonel:
        Are you there? Raiden, you’re needed on Strut C.

Rose’s voice suddenly goes on air. Her image, full of static, is on-screen.

Colonel:

Rose:
        Jack, tell me you’re okay.
Raiden:
        I’m all right. It was a close one, though.
Rose:
        (relieved) Oh good...
Raiden:

Rose:
        I didn’t think it would be this tough.
Raiden:

Rose:

Colonel:
        Rosemary - maybe this was a miscalculation on my part.
Colonel:
        Selecting her wasn’t the wisest choice.
Rose:
        No, no, (regains her cool) I apologize for the outburst.
Rose:
        I’m all right, sir.
Colonel:
        (Half-convinced) Hmm...
Colonel:
        Raiden, how about you?
Raiden:
        I’m good.
Colonel:
        Then the mission goes on.
Colonel:
        But Rosemary, there’s one thing I need you to understand.
Rose:

Colonel:
        His name is Raiden. Got it?
Rose:
        Yes sir. I understand.

    From Peter encounter 1
      To Peter encounter 15



P014_01_P01 Peter encounter 1 polygon demo 1 (MC)
Kitchen, Strut C personnel quarters

Raiden enters Strut C in search of the bomb disposal expert. Strut C serves
as living quarters for the Shell Personnel, and contains the cafeteria,
kitchen, etc. There are no signs of the enemy.
As Raiden enters the kitchen, he hears something. He continues on cautiously
and discovers a man at work in front of the long counter. An array of tools
and equipment lines the countertop. A man, a well-built African-American in
his late 50s (only his upper body is visible), is so wrapped up in his work
that he does not notice Raiden’s arrival. He is wearing a leather jacket with
NYPD Bomb Squad emblazoned on the back (Raiden cannot yet see this). His
head is a smooth egg-shape, completely devoid of hair. To Raiden, he looks
like a bomber at work.


Raiden:
        Freeze!

Raiden aims his gun (SOCOM). Peter jumps at the intrusion.

Peter:
        Don’t Shoot!

Peter raises both his hands. There are a pliers(which look like a weapon) in
one hand. The lettering on his jacket is now visible to Raiden, who weighs
its implication.

Raiden:
        You a cop?
Peter:
        I’m not NYPD. I came in with the Bravo team.

Raiden’s nerves are not in the best shape thanks to his encounters with the
vampire and Fortune. He keeps his finger on the trigger and the gun pointed
at the man. Raiden is reminded of what happened to the Alpha team. The man
fires a barrage of questions at Raiden.

Peter:
        Who are you? And what happened to SEAL Team 10?
Raiden:
        They’re all dead...
Peter:
        All of them!? That’s bad...

Peter rises slowly. He sinks into thought, and lowers his hand once,
distractedly. Raiden immediately goes into high alert(isosceles stance) and
points his weapon at Peter.

Raiden:
        Did I tell you that you could move?

At that moment, a noise sounds from the large door on the cafeteria side.

Pliskin:
        It’s all right. He’s not one of the bad guys.

Raiden swings the barrel towards the voice. Pliskin enters fro the cafeteria
side, an M4 slung over one shoulder. He looks less ill than he did before.

Pliskin:
        Don’t go pointing that thing everywhere, kid.

Raiden, recognizing Pliskin, lowers his gun. Pliskin walks up to Peter. He
appears completely at ease.

Pliskin:
        What’s your name?
Peter:
        My name is Peter. Peter Stillman.

Pliskin digs into his memory for facts about peter.

Pliskin:
        Lecturer at NAVSCOLEOD Indianhead... Also a consultant for the NYPD
        Bomb Squad.

Peter’s face darkens (because Pliskin has heard of him, also for having his
past accomplishments enumerated in this way).

Peter:
        A poor old man who got dragged along for this picnic.

Peter gets up and walks over. His right leg is disabled, and he limps
heavily.

Pliskin:
        I thought you’d retired.
Peter:
        I did. Can’t keep up with everybody, as you can see.

His right leg is a prosthesis. In his right hand is a cane.

Peter:
        A famous church got wiped off the map thanks to me. With too many
        lives inside. All I lost with this leg.

Raiden does not understand much of the conversation. What he can follow is that
this is the explosives expert that came in with the Bravo team.

Raiden:
        So you’re the bomb disposal guy?

Pliskin:
        Kid, this is THE bomb disposal guy. Open any explosives disposal
        textbook and you’ll see his name.
Raiden:
        ...

Raiden is put off at being treated like a rookie by Pliskin. Peter, sensing his
chagrin, speaks up.

Peter:
        Heh, just ancient history now.
Raiden:
        Why did they bring you out of retirement then?
Peter:
        Because the terrorist group includes one of my students.

A picture (Shinkawa work) of Fatman. Transform the illustration and game data
into a movie like in the previous title (TGS movie). Rotate the images
against the backdrop of a 3D model.

Peter:
        The Emperor of Explosives  Fatman. He built an atomic bomb (the
        Fatman model) when he was only ten. I created him in a sense.
Pliskin:
        And that’s why you’re here...
Peter:
        I’m pretty rusty. I was supposed to supervise the bomb disposal 
        looks like it was taken care of before I had my turn.
Pliskin:
        I wouldn’t say that.

Kitchen, Strut C personnel quarters

Pliskin looks toward Raiden.

Pliskin:
        There are at least two people here who claim to be experts at bomb
        disposal.

Raiden looks back at Pliskin, then glares at him as the implication sinks in

Raiden:
        ?

Peter studies the two of him.

Pliskin:
        Are you two with SEAL Team 10 I didn’t see out at the mission
        briefing.
Pliskin:
        Oh, we’re with another squad.

He tries to change the topic.

Pliskin:
        My name is Pliskin, Lieutenant Junior Grade. Honored to meet you,
        sir.

Pliskin holds out his hand, but Peter ignores it. Instead he inquires earnestly:

Peter:
        Mr. Pliskin, do you have any experience with explosives disposal.
Pliskin:
        Don’t worry about me. And he looks young, but he can do it. We need
        more manpower.
Raiden:
        I’m ah -(reluctant)
Peter:
        What’s your name?
Raiden:
        Raiden.
Peter:
        That’s an odd name.

Raiden looks away then asks:

Raiden:
        Any other survivors?
Peter:
        There was also an engineer with me.
Raiden:
        An engineer?

chopper ride together. Visuals of the descent, etc.

Peter:
        A skinny guy. He went in with us...(refers to Otacon).
Raiden:
        Was he killed?
Peter:
        I don’t think so. I didn’t find his body.
Pliskin:
        murmurs to himself and smiles secretly) I see... (that he is safe)

Otacon boarding the chopper (silhouette)

Peter:
        They told me he was the security systems architect for the Big Shell.
Raiden:
        Why would they take a civilian along?
Peter:
        Everything in this structure is computer controlled. He was supposed
        to get us past all the security measures.
Raiden:
        I never heard anything about that.
Peter:
        He had official orders with him.
Raiden:
        ...(suspicious)
Pliskin:
        (Changing the subject) We’ll leave that for later. Right now, we need
        to figure out how to deal with all the bombs.
Raiden:
        But there’s no one left from the SEAL’s EOD (Explosive Ordinance
        Disposal) squad (Bravo team)...
Pliskin:
        Yep. So we have to do it ourselves.
Raiden:
        But I’ve never defused a bomb before... (suddenly uncertain)

The Codec CALL sound interrupts Raiden mid-sentence.

Raiden:
        Hold on a sec.
Pliskin:
        Off to confer with the CO again?

Colonel:
        Glad to hear Stillman is safe. Assist him in any way possible to
        clear the C4 from the structure.
Raiden:
        Colonel, you know I’ve never been trained in bomb disposal.
Colonel:
        It’s all right. The man you’re working with is the best in the field.
        All you have to do is follow is directions.
Colonel:
        You will of course keep your true identity and mission objectives to
        your self.
Raiden:
        Is it true that an engineer came in with Stillman?
Colonel:
        I wasn’t informed of that. It’s probably something the SEAL’s decided
        on their own.
Raiden:
        ...
Colonel:
        There are more important issues at hand, Raiden. The enemy may
        retaliate for the failed assault. Get those C4’s neutralized now.
Raiden:
        Colonel, I’m not qualified for bomb disposal.

Rose interrupts

Rose:
        Jack, it’s me.
Raiden:
        Rose?
Rose:
        You can do this. Trust me.
Colonel:
        You haven’t had bomb disposal training per se in VR, but you’re more
        than capable of handling C4.
Raiden:
        ...This is a little different from using C4.
Rose:
        You’re up for this. You know that.
Pliskin:
        (OFF)How about it, kid? Are the results in yet?

Kitchen, Strut C personnel quarters

Raiden looks at the tabletop, seen in first-person view. The camera can pan
left, right, up and down, but cannot be moved. Pan left and right as the
lines are spoken. Same specs as the torture. Pliskin in next to Raiden but
behind, and does not fall into his field of vision.

Peter:
        There’s no need to think about this so much.
Peter:
        You won’t actually be dismantling the bomb. That’s not for amateurs.
        What we’ll try here instead is a temporary freezing measure.
Peter:
        Here, look at this -

Peter’s demonstration. He sweeps aside the tools on the tabletop with his
arm, and puts down a sample C4 charge.

Peter:
        This is a C4 bomb...

He flips the switch and the diode attached to the C4 glows green

Peter:
        It’s live. You can see it pulsing.

The flickering rhythm of the green light does resemble a pulse. Peter takes
out a coolant spray.

Peter:
        Now you can spray this on the sucker and...

Peter shakes the spray can several times and sprays the contents on the C4.
The C4 is frozen, and the disposal is complete. The green indicator dies. A
close-up or long shot of the bomb.

Peter:
        ...There we go. Simple, huh? The spray freezes the detonator
        instantly.
Raiden:
        How long does the effect last?
Peter:
        There’s not way the thing can detonate in this condition. Even if you
        leave it alone, it’ll stay out of commission for at least 24 hours.
Pliskin:
        That’s enough time.
Peter:
        If we had the manpower, I’d recommend complete disposal. But this
        will have to do. The spray can be used from several yards away. Check
        the floor, ceiling, walls, under a table - everywhere. Try to
        imagine the locations the bomber would choose.
Pliskin:
        That won’t be easy. We don’t know a thing about Fatman.
Raiden:
        Is there anything that’ll help us locate the bombs?
Peter:
        Here, take this with you.

Peter takes out a bomb disposal sensor A and holds it up to Raiden and
Pliskin.

Peter:
        It’s what they call an Ion Mobility Spectrometer. It can recognize
        ionized gas emitted by C4’s.

A close-up of bomb disposal sensor A.

Raiden:
        ...the what?
Pliskin:
        (translates for Raiden since he seems not to have understood) In
        other words, that little gizmo sniffs out C4’s scent.
Peter:
        That’s right. I’ve established a link with your radar network, so any
        scent detected will be represented visually. Have the sensor
        activated and keep your eye on the radar.
Raiden:
        (uneasily) What if he’s using some other, odorless substance?

P014_07_M03 Peter encounter 7 movie demo 3 (Fatman)
Movie of Fatman

Visuals of Fatman (illustration) during the Indian Head times. Peter
reminisces about Fatman nostalgically.

Peter:
      I know Fatman well. I know how into his own aesthetics he is.
Pliskin:
        Signatures?
Peter:
        Yes. On every bomb he builds, he always leaves a trace of the cologne
        he uses. The sensor also picks up that particular scent spectrum.
Pliskin:
        Is that something he learned for you?
Peter:
        No, it was his own quirk. He wouldn’t work by any set of rules except
        his own, and he followed them like a religion. And common sense
        wasn’t one of his strong points.
Peter:
        I though I taught him everything I knew...
Peter:
        I have no children of my own, and I thought I found a son in him.
Peter:
        He had the right stuff, you know.
Peter:
        Even and Indian Head, he got special treatment.
Peter:
        I remember some people called him one of the ‘fat cats’.
Peter:
        Maybe that’s what started all this.
Peter:
        I didn’t teach him the most important thing I had to tell him.
Peter:
        There are some things you have to pass on. The trick is to know which
        ones.
Peter:
        Right... All I taught him were skills.
Peter:
        And now I have to stop him from using it to destroy us all.

Peter:

entire area of the women’s restroom, partially shown to the south of the
kitchen section. The radar does not display the whole of the women’s room
however, but shows only its southern half. At this time, even if the radar is
switched off, the screen will continue to show the Soliton.

Peter:
        You see the green stuff on the radar? That’s a visual representation
        of the C4 scent detected by the sensor.
Raiden:
        It’s a pretty big area, isn’t it?
Pliskin:
        Don’t complain. It’s better than nothing. (not much of a rebuttal)
Peter:
        (slightly hurt) Just activate the sensors and search the area, okay?
Raiden:
        All right.
Peter:
        Don’t forget that you need the radar to use this system.
Peter:
        Log into the node at every strut and turn the radar on.
Pliskin:
        We have to keep out of the enemy’s sight too.
Raiden:

Pliskin:

Peter:
        Of course. I taught him the techniques he uses. His ideas are based
        on my theories. Demolition is a kind of ideology; it makes no
        exceptions for time or place.
Peter:
        Big Shell consists of two hexagons joined end-on-end, north to south.
        There should be packets of C4s on each of the vertices, or the struts
        in this case. You need at least that to take a building of this

The demo reverts to the kitchen setting. Pliskin quickly puts away his card.

Pliskin:
        We’ll have to deal with the remaining security lockouts as they come
        up.
Pliskin:
        Let’s get going.

Peter, assuming he is going with them, starts to move out. Pliskin stops him.

Pliskin:
        You stay here.
Peter:
        No, I’m going
Pliskin:
        The two of us can handle it, don’t worry.
Peter:
        But --
Pliskin:
        You’ll just slow us down with that leg of yours. (intentionally cruel
        to protect Peter)
Peter:
        ...(caught in his own lies about his leg)
Pliskin:
        There’s a war going on here. I don’t have time to baby-sit anymore.

Peter looks down and Pliskin continues to stare at him coldly. A minute or two
of silence.

Raiden:
        (Attempting to play the peacemaker) Why don’t you let us handle the
        grunt work? You can tell us what to do over the radio, like in the
        original mission plan.
Pliskin:
        (Grins secretly as Raiden responds exactly as he had foreseen.
        Cynical SOB.)
Peter:
        All right.

Peter sits down heavily.

Peter:
        I’ll give you instructions form here. I may also need to prepare a
        backup plan just in case...(construction and calibration of Sensor B)
Raiden:
        In case of what?

Peter pointedly ignores Raiden’s query.

Peter:
        Good luck to both of you. This is a dangerous one.
Pliskin:
        Who Dares, Wins.

Peter registers Pliskin’s words wit some suspicion.

Peter:
        If anything comes up, let me know. My frequency is 140.25.
Pliskin:
        Good luck, kid. I’ll see you later.

He pats Raiden on the back.

Pliskin:
        Semper fi.

He utters the USMC motto then leaves the kitchen. Peter watches Pliskin as he
walks out of earshot.

Peter:
        That’s man’s no SEAL. I don’t even think he’s a Navy man.
Raiden:
        What?

He is taken aback by Peter’s words.

Peter:

Peter:
        Normally, team leaders stay in the CP(Command Post) and give orders

        officers away from the field.
Raiden:

Peter:

Raiden:

Peter:

Raiden is concerned for Peter’s safety.

Raiden:
        What about you? They could be back in this area soon.
Peter:
        I’ll hide out in this pantry for a while.

Peter opens the door to the pantry, located behind them.

Peter:
        If I lock the door, it should be all right. Plenty of food in here
        too, so you won’t need to worry about me. I’ll give you instructions
        by Codec from here. Good luck -- kid.

Peter imitates Pliskin.

Peter:
        Bomb disposal is a face-off with your own mortality. Don’t let the fear
        get to you.

He seems to be talking to himself.

Raiden, having defused the first bomb, raises Peter on the Radio. Peter finds
out where the bomb was set and grows perturbed.

Peter:
        That’s not like him...
Raiden:
        Anything wrong?
Peter:
        Maybe. Pliskin’s reported other locations too, and none of them are
        effective demolition points.
Raiden:
        What do you mean?
Peter:
        It means they would be the best places to choose if you wanted to
        destroy this place.
Raiden:
        Are you saying they don’t plan on blowing the Shell up?
Peter:
        It certainly seems that way. So far, we haven’t see anything but a
        waste of good explosives. Unless of course, we’re missing
        something...
Raiden:
        A trap?

Peter:
        This is all wrong. This is something only an amateur would do.
Raiden:
        What do you mean?
Peter:
        All the bombs that have been found so far don’t appear to be in the
        right kind of locations. And the quantity of explosives isn’t
        sufficient either.
Raiden:
        Even Fatman can make mistakes, right?
Peter:
        No, there’s something else going on here...
Peter:
        Get a move on with the disposal, Raiden. I’ve got a bad feeling about
        this.
Raiden:
        Do you think it’s a trap?

Raiden:
        (Slightly peeved) Yeah, I’d say so.
Rose:
        OK, that was a stupid thing to say. Sorry
Raiden:
        That’s all right(with an effort). It’s just that I’ve never been
        trained in this stuff.
Rose:
        You okay? Are you feeling well?
Raiden:
        I almost threw up a few times.
Rose:
        Oh Jack...
Raiden:
        But I’m okay. It’s not like I’m in this alone.
Rose:
        Oh - yeah, that’s true.(realizing he is talking about Pliskin,
        not her)
Rose:
        What do you think about when you’re defusing those things?
Raiden:
        I don’t think so much as remember. And I know that I need to resist
        that, and keep my mind blank. I can’t let myself be overwhelmed
        by the fear.

Rose tries to divert Raiden.

Rose:
        So am I a part of what you try not to remember?
Raiden:
        (laugh)
Rose:
        I was just kidding. But I guess this isn’t a good time for that.
Raiden:
        No, it is. And I do think about you - I’m trying to remember what’s
        so special about April 30th.
Rose:
        Any success?
Raiden:
        No, not yet.

Raiden:
        Huh? What are you talking about?
Rose:
        Carefully dismantling emotional defenses, being on your toes
        constantly. You know?
Raiden:
        I guess. Neither of them are my strong point.
Rose:
        It’s true that you’re not the most patient man in the world. (laugh)
Raiden:
        It’s not that. I like to leave things as they are.
Rose:
        Are you afraid of hat might be hidden inside?

A Codec CALL from Rose during a disposal. Rose is trying to keep Raiden
from breaking down.

Rose:
        Jack, do you remember the day we met?
Raiden:
        I’m kinda busy right now, Rose.
Rose:
        You’re right, sorry.
Raiden:
        (Realizing her true intent) I do remember.
Raiden:
        It was right after I transferred to New York. There were all these
        tourists around you , in front of the Federal Hall.
Rose:
        A group of middle-aged Japanese ladies came up and asked me which
        building it was that King Kong was climbing in the movie.
Raiden:
        You pointed out the World Trade Center.
Rose:
        But the ladies weren’t convinced.
Raiden:
        The tourists were talking about the black and white King Kong.
Rose:
        I said it was probably the Chrysler Building.
Raiden:
        You hadn’t seen the black and white original.
Rose:
        I just vaguely remembered the pictures. And then you showed up and
        started mouthing off.
Rose:
        You were like, ‘No, it’s the Empire State.’
Raiden:
        I said the Chrysler Building was in Godzilla.
Rose:
        (laughs at the reminiscence)
Rose:
        We started arguing, and I forgot all about the tourists.
Rose:
        I was insisting that I was right and you were doing the same...
Rose:
        The next thing we knew, the Japanese women had gone away.
Rose:
        And we ended up going to the Skyscraper Museum(ca.2001) to see who
        had the better recall.
Raiden:
        We argued all the way to Battery park.
Rose:
        And for nothing:
Raiden:
        Since the museum was closed.
Raiden:
        We (becoming suddenly shy) went out separate ways from the museum.
Raiden:
        And then I found you again by coincidence out in the base (FOXHOUND)
        corridor.
Rose:
        An amazing coincidence(not in reality)—- that we were actually
        working at the same place.
Raiden:
        That night, we went up to the top of the Empire State.
Rose:
        It was so beautiful - I could look down on the Chrysler Building
        from  hundred and twenty stories above ground.
Raiden:
        I felt - overwhelmed.
Raiden:
        I didn’t care anymore who was right.
Rose:
        And that was our first date. (as though recalling the event)
Raiden:
        We watched ‘King Kong’ I your apartment a bunch of times that night.
Raiden:
        Didn’t sleep till morning...
Rose:
        (sigh)
Raiden:
        If it weren’t for that coincidence, we wouldn’t be together.
Rose:
        I know... (self-loathing)
Rose:
        I’m sorry, Jack. I’m taking up your time again. (In reality, Rose
        engineered contact with Raiden by the Patriots’ order)
Raiden:

        Why did you contact me?
Mr. X:
        Let’s just say I’m one of your fans.

Ask the colonel.

Raiden:
        Colonel, someone calling himself Mr.X just contacted me. Do you now
        anything about it?
Colonel:
        No  and whoever it was, it wasn’t a burst transmission. The
        transmission was sent from inside the Big Shell.
Raiden:
        He called himself ‘Deepthroat’ at first. Do you think --?
Colonel:
        I caught that part too, but the possibility of it being true is none.
        Grey Fox is the one who used that alias at Shadow Moses,

someone talking(from the radio). Shades of Snake and Olga in the Tanker
Chapter.

Solidus:(OFF)
        I’ve taken care of that annoying fly (the SEAL helicopter). What’s

Olga:
        Puzzling. I saw a man dressed like a ninja just now.
Solidus:(OFF)
        Ninja?
Olga:
        That’s the only way to describe it. A kind of cyborg ninja, complete
with a sword.

Solidus:(OFF)(Surprised) What...!

Raiden walks out in the direction of the voices. He can see Olga at the top
of the stairs. She wears tiger-stripe urban camos over a ninja inner wear.

Olga:
        Are you hiding something from me?
Solidus:(OFF)
        Olga, are you it wasn’t an Aresenal Tengu? (referring to the special
squadron attached to Arsenal, a new model of Metal Gear)

Olga denies the suggestion (and with it the user’s suspicion that she herself
may be the ninja) vehemently.

Olga:
        Don’t be a fool. Think I wouldn’t know the difference? I’ve never seen
field gear like that, ever.
Solidus:(OFF)
        All right. We’ll intensify patrols. Anything else?
Olga:
        Actually...one more thing. You’ll find it hard to believe, though.

Olga seems reluctant. She is leaning on the railings of the stairs.

Olga:
        I aw a man hiding under a cardboard box.
Solidus:(OFF)

Olga:
        On the connecting bridge to Shell 2.

Olga puts away the radio.

Olga:
        Of course not. What a thing to say.
Raiden:
        Drop your gun!

Olga smiles widely.

Olga:
        Not a chance!

And leaps over the railing Arabian style. Raiden rushes to the spot, and
looks down, but there is no trace of Olga in the water. Raiden kneels down

Raiden:
        I’m listening.
Pliskin:
        I checked out the bottom of Strut H for you, Pete.
Raiden:
        Wait - what’s this about? (he has not been told)
Peter:
        I asked Pliskin to look around. Knowing Fatman, I can’t shake the
        feeling that all the bombs so far were just wrong.
Raiden:
        So did you find anything?
Pliskin:
        A hell of a lot of C4’s packed into the bottom of the Strut. Pete
        called it right.
Peter:
        I knew he had the real thing up his sleeve...
Raiden:
        So all the other ones were dummies?
Peter:
        No, they’re a threat all right, but the detonation wouldn’t be enough
        to destroy the entire Shell. But the C4’s Pliskin found would inflict
        serious structural damage.
Pliskin:
        That’s not the bad news either. These are sensor-proof.
Peter:
        What!
Pliskin:
        New model, I guess. The ionization sensor can’t detect them.
Pliskin:
        The whole thing is sealed tight to prevent vapor leak, and there’s no
        trace of that cologne signature. Pete, it looks like he fooled you.
Peter:
        Yes...(realizing that Fatman is so out of control that he will fully
        abandon a long-standing code)
Raiden:
        But you managed to find the thing anyway? (impressed)

        (Reaches a decision) I’ll go see for myself.
Raiden:
        You can’t move fast enough.
Pliskin:
        He’s right. I can try the spray from a distance.
Peter:
        Hold on! There’s something not right about this one, I can feel it.
Pliskin:
        Well, Pete? Should I come back and get you?
Peter:
        No, there’s no need. Raiden, you have one left to go correct?

Pliskin:
        I have two left not counting this one.

Peter:

Pliskin:

Peter:
        That bomb, five years ago. I messed up. Even with all my experience,
        I lost it.
Peter:
        And a church was lost in the explosion. All those kids playing nearby
        too...
Raiden:

Peter:
        Yes, lied. I didn’t lose my leg in the explosion.
Pliskin:
        ...
Peter:
        So many dead - all because of my mistake. All I could think about
        was hiding from the crime, shielding myself fro the public outcry. I
        wanted people to be sorry for me, for my weakness...
Raiden:

        I faked being a victim myself because I couldn’t bear to face the

        This is no prosthetic. I can keep my footing on catwalks and hike
        over deserts.
Peter:
        I lived my lie so well I haven’t even answered to myself for my
        sins...
Peter:
        It was supposed to be a shield.
Peter:
        And it’s become a shroud instead.
Peter:
        I’ve killed my soul by playing the victim.
Peter:
        Instead of protecting me, it’s made my life even more hellish.
Pliskin:
        What good can that do the victims?
Peter:
        I know - I’m a coward --!
Pliskin:
        Hey, Pete.
Peter:
        God, forgive me...
Peter:
        I can walk on my own two feet.
Peter:
        And I need them to stop Fatman. His crimes are also mine —- one of
        emission, and arrogance. No one should teach the skills I taught him
        without a clear conscience.
Peter:
        This is the only way I can defuse my own sins.
Pliskin:
        I get you, Pete. That one’s all yours. You got it, Raiden?
Raiden:
        I understand.
Pliskin:
        Pete, I’ve taken care of the guards in Struts G and H of Shell 2. I
        wouldn’t recommend you go into any of the other struts.
Peter:
        I owe you one.
Pliskin:
        I’ll get back to freezing the baby bombs then.
Peter:
        You do that too, Raiden.
Raiden:
        I’m on it.
Peter:
        I’ll have the radio with me, if you need to get in touch. Just don’t
        ask for ‘Peg-legged Peter’. He’s gone for good

Raiden defuses the last bomb and calls Peter.

Raiden:
        I have the last C4 frozen. There’s nothing showing up on the sensor
        now.
Peter:
        Good work Raiden.
Pliskin:
        You’re way ahead of me, kid. I still have one to go.
Raiden:
        How’s your bomb, Peter?
Peter:
        It’s a bomb all right. Sealed C4, and in huge quantities...
Raiden:
        You think there’s another one in Shell 1?
Peter:
        For sure. Somewhere at the bottom of Strut A.
Raiden:
        What are you so certain?
Peter:
        If this bottom section of the strut is demolished, Shell 2 will be
        well on its way to destruction
Pliskin:
        You mean that Shell 2 will actually sink?
Peter:
        Not immediately. There’ll still be five struts left.
Peter:
        But, if Shell 1 loses a strut at the same time, it’ll be a very
        different story.
Peter:
        The Big Shell’s structural integrity depends on a very exact balance.
        If both Shells lose a strut each, the whole structure will tear
        itself apart under its own weight.
Raiden:
        What do we do?
Peter:
        I have a sensor that can locate even those scentless C4’s. It makes
        combined use of a neutron scintillator and a hydrogen bomb detector.
Raiden:
        You brought that stuff with you?
Peter:
        Of course. I made the calibrations while I was in the pantry.
Raiden:
        Does it work?
Peter:
        I just tested it, and it definitely responds. But the best I can do
        is a sound beacon, not the radar.
Raiden:
        Sound?
Peter:
        The shorter the interval between beacons, the closer the target.
Raiden:
        I got you.
Peter:
        There’s another one in that pantry I was in. You can go back and get
        it.
Pliskin:
        It’s all yours, Raiden.
Peter:
        I’m going to study it some more, and see if the freezing process will
        work. Don’t touch the other one till I say so.
Raiden:
        Ok. I’ll standby until you radio in.

Pliskin:

        few enemy sentries I have to take care of.
Raiden:

Peter:
        Maybe. It’s an odd one - the detonator hasn’t been activated.
Raiden:

Peter:
        But the sensors are live... which means... (sinks into thought)

Colonel:

Raiden:

Colonel:
        Yes, it was.
Raiden:
        Colonel, any damage report on the explosion?
Colonel:
        Seems that the duct for diverting the contaminated sea water was
        destroyed. And the central section of Shell 2 is flooding.
Colonel:
        And the explosion’s ignited the oil slick on the surface.
Raiden:

Colonel:
        The chemicals stayed in containment. There’s no immediate danger.
Raiden:
        Is the Big Shell stable?
Colonel:
        Shell 1 was unaffected. The price was high, but the threat of the
        bomb is over for now.

P028_01_P01 Bomb disposal/Re-enter Fortune 1 Polygon demo 1(MC)
Elevator hall, bottom of Strut A

Raiden waits for the elevator to come down to the elevator hall. After a
short while, the elevator descends into view and comes to a stop. The door
opens, and a slender black woman steps out. Fortune is coatless, dressed only
in a leather leotard that leaves her arms and legs bare. She looks more like
a model than a battled-hardened soldier, and appears totally incongruous in
her surroundings. Her hair is tossing though there is no hint of a breeze in
the hall (caused by the electromagnetic field). Discard if difficult to
execute modeling wise. The insects(from the pool) make a beeline for Fortune
as if the had been waiting for a shepherd. Rather than make contact with
Fortune’s skin, they simple range about her.
Raiden conceals himself behind some objects in the center of the elevator
hall. Fortune, completely at ease, takes aim with her long linear rifle. She
begins to talk, seemingly completely aware of Raiden’s presence, whom in
actuality she believes is Snake. Vamp has informed her of the arrival of
Snake, her father’s killer, in the Big Shell. Assuming he is responsible for
the neutralization of their bombs, Fortune has come to seek him out. Her
objective is to kill him - or alternately to be killed by him.

Fortune:
        I can’t tell you how happy I am that you were alive after all. I knew
        this moment would come.
Fortune:
        Show yourself and finish me - like you finished off my father!
Fortune:
        Otherwise, you’ll be the one to die.

Fortune fires the rifle two or three times. The shots take out the upper part
of the container concealing Raiden.
One of these shots will blow away a pipe at the top of the door to the
previous area, bringing down a shower of rubble, blocking the way.

Raiden:
        Oh crap!

Raiden moves to another concealment, and Fortune sees his face.

Fortune:
        That’s not -him?

Raiden ducks into the shadows.

Fortune:
        This could be -interesting. You’ve seen the fires of hell, haven’t
        you? [Fortune with her uncanny ability to sense terror in others,
        realizes that Raiden carries with him a dark past. His childhood, in
        fact, was spent as a boy soldier in the ruthless fronts of the
        Liberian civil conflicts. Subplot.]

Fortune:
        Maybe you can give me death...?

Behind her, the elevator begins its ascent. She glances at it, then smiles in
satisfaction. Raiden also looks to the departing elevator, but with
frustrated longing.

Fortune:
        My name is Fortune, lucky in war and nothing else...
Fortune:
        And without a death to call my own.

She turns to Raiden and coolly utter her request:

Elevator hall, bottom of Strut A

Raiden cannot hit Fortune at all. On the other hand, he is fast losing places
of concealment to her linear rifle. When all the hiding places are lost or
after five minutes of battle, the elevator arrives.

The elevator comes to a stop and Vamp steps out. He runs up behind Fortune.

Vamp:
        I’ll take over, Queen.
Fortune:
        What is it?
Vamp:
        It seems our friend Fatman is out of control.
Fortune:
        He’ll actually try to destroy this place?
Vamp:
        Yes. This could unravel everything we’ve planned.
Fortune:
        But why would he do such a thing?
Vamp:
        Who knows? But he’s nothing more than a stereotypical mad bomber now.
        He’s completely lost sight of our ideals.
Vamp:
        And with it, his loyalty to Commander Jackson (Fortune’s husband and
        the Dead Cell leader who died in prison after he was falsely(?)
        incarcerated)
Fortune:
        All right. I’ll take care of the wayward soul.

Fortune indicates Raiden with her chin.

Fortune:
        (sadly)It wasn’t him (Snake)...
Vamp:
        Unfortunate.
Fortune:
        I expected more of this one, really.
Vamp:
        But he couldn’t kill you, I see.
Fortune:
        (Sulkily) Completely useless.

Vamp smiles unpleasantly.

Vamp:
        Then he’s all mine.

Fortune puts her linear rifle down and returns it to her back. Raiden,
listening to them speak from his hiding spot, wonders if he can land a shot.

Fortune:
        Later, Vamp?

Fortune takes her leave in a sultry, intimate voice, then turns around and
walks toward the elevator. Her guard is down, and Raiden cannot fail to
miss the opportunity.

Raiden:
        Now!

Raiden lets loose a burst of gunfire (2-3 shots) at Fortune. Slow motion: The
bullets veer away in front of Fortune and instead find Vamp’s brow and side.
A gaping hole appears on Vamp’s forehead, and he crumples.

Vamp:
        (grunt)
Fortune:
        !

Fortune swivels at the hips and catches Vamp on his downward arc. His weight
forces her down on her knees. Vamp is bleeding from the side as well. Raiden
fires again, but the rounds miss Fortune once again.

Raiden:
        Damn!

Raiden finds cover once again. Fortune places her hand on Vamp’s brow.

Fortune:
        Vamp? Are you gone?

Vamp looks to be dead. Fortune takes his hand and squeezes it tenderly.

Fortune:
        No. No, that death was meant for me.

Raiden rises to his feet (and still aiming his gun), approaches Fortune
cautiously.

Fortune:
        Why am I the only one tat can’t die!

Fortune has lost her will to fight.

Fortune:
        Alone again... Cheated out of death again... how long will you force
        me to live!
Fortune:

She weeps hysterically (almost indistinguishable from laughter), crouched on
the floor.

Fortune:
        How much longer, Dad? You’ve punished me enough...(sob)

Fortune is lost in the anguish, Vamp in her arms. Raiden walks up to her and
places the barrel of his gun on the back of her head.

Fortune:
        I thought you could give me peace.
Fortune:
        But your couldn’t kill me either.

Raiden puts his gun away, chastened by the thought of the bomb and the
countdown. Still on full alert, he steps onto the elevator. It begins its
ascent, and Fortune glances sideways at Raiden, her eyes full of tears. The
elevator climbs higher, and Fortune disappears from view. Her despairing cry
echoes I the elevator cage.

Fortune:
        (sobbing)

Raiden reaches the upper level as Fortune grieves. Her tears fall on Vamp’s
forehead - and suddenly, he opens his eyes.

Vamp:
        There’s no need for sorrow, Queen.

White breath curls from Vamp’s mouth. Fortune comes to with a Start.

Fortune:
        !?
Vamp:
        I died once already.
Fortune:
        Vamp?
Vamp:
        I can’t die twice.

Fortune clasps Vamp’s face between her palms and caresses him.

P032_01_P01 Enter Fatman 1 polygon demo 1 (MC+KF)
Heliport, roof of Strut E

Raiden hurries onto the heliport, leaving Fortune and Vamp behind. There are
no enemy soldiers in sight. The air is still, and the area is eerily silent.
Fatman’s voice booms through this stillness.

Fatman:(OFF)
        So you’re the one... (he has been ordered by the Patriots to test
Raiden. No explanation is offered. Subplot)
Fatman:(OFF)
        You’re right on time, I see. I like a punctual man.

The sound of a clock fades in. Raiden looks around, searching for the source
of the sound and the voice. Fatman is not yet in sight. The sound of inline
skates.

Raiden:
        Is he Dead Cell?
Fatman:(OFF)
        I am Fatman!
Fatman:(OFF)
        I am the greatest that humanity has to offer, and the lowest. (a
        trill of pride in the ‘lowest’ part)

Raiden, thinking of Peter, clenches his fist.

Fatman:(OFF)
        Can you hear it? Hear this rhythm?

The sound grows louder. A shadow swishes among the containers.

Fatman:(OFF)
        It’s the rhythm of time. And life!

A click and a new sound joins the existing rhythm. (The sound of Fatman
setting C4’s)

Fatman:(OFF)
        Don’t you love the sound?
Fatman:(OFF)
        I used to hang around department store clock counters.

Raiden checks the area, but the containers block his view.
Suddenly, Fatman appears from behind one of the containers. On his feet are a
pair of inline skates, and in one hand a cocktail glass filled with wine and
topped with a twist-straw. He wears a green blast suit, the high blast-shield
collar hiding his chin and mouth. His head is hairless. The hand that holds
the glass is as white and slender as a debutante’s, every nail adorned with
scarlet manicure. The high collar leaves everything but the piercing eyes
covered. His hairless scalp is burned into a reddened terrain of scar
tissues.

Fatman:
        Life is short
Fatman:
        Bombs tell the time with every moment of their existence. And
nothing else announces its own end with such a fanfare.

Fatman declares, then raises his glass to Raiden.

Fatman:
        Glad you could make it. The party’s about to start...

He sucks up the wine in a single slurp. The long straw delivers the glass’s
content into his mouth, over the restricting collar.

Fatman:
        Yum... Good year. Let’s drink to Stillman, shall we?

A long shot of the heliport.

Raiden:
        If you destroy the Big Shell, you’ll never collect your ransom.
Fatman:
        Ransom? What are you talking about?
Raiden:
        Thirty Billion in cash?
Fatman:
        (Abruptly breaks into peals of laughter)
Raiden:
        !?
Fatman:
        (laugh)... So that’s what’s going on, huh? (Solidus has made no
        ransom demands. Fatman realizes Raiden has been lied to by his CO,
        the Colonel, who is seeking to recreate an imitation of Shadow Moses
        on behalf of the Patriots)
Raiden:
        What the hell are you talking about?
Fatman:
        (chuckling) Oh, you’ll know soon enough. And I could care less what
        they(= the Patriots, but let the users think it to be Solidus & co.)
        plan to do. My ambitions are much more simple: To be the most famous
        bomber of them all.
Raiden:
        You’re nuts. No one’s going to give a damn about you.
Fatman:
        Oh, yes they will. I’ll go down in history as the man who beat Peter
        Stillman. That’s the only reason I assisted them(the Patriots).
Raiden:
        Like hell you beat Stillman. He had your number.
Fatman:
        (anger) What did you say?
Raiden:
        You have nothing of his courage or --
Fatman:
        (sneering laughter)
Raiden:
        What are you laughing at?
Fatman:
        That crock died a dishonorable death six months ago.(referring to the
        Dead Cell’s decimation)
Raiden:
        Six months ago  the liquidation of Dead Cell.(a quick review for
        the users)
Fatman:
        Call it what you want. Only the right stuff survived that hell. It
        set me free, you know? Opened the way to a new dimension...
Fatman:
        (Proudly) So that I could become the emperor among detonation
        devotees.
Raiden:
        You’re nothing but a common criminal. And that’s the only way people
        will ever remember you.

Fatman flings his glass to the floor, where it shatters into pieces.

Fatman:
        How dare you! I’m an artist!

He whisks away into the shadows.

Fatman:
        This is why I dislike boorish military types.

Fatman sticks out his head and informs Raiden:

Fatman:
        It’s time to start the party...
Fatman:
        This is how it works: I plant a bomb...
Fatman:
        And it explodes soon after that.
Fatman:
        If you prefer to stay in one piece, you’ll have to disable my bombs.

The LED light on the bomb that was presumably set first suddenly turns from
green to amber. Fatman breaks into a sudden peal of laughter.

Fatman:
        ‘Laugh and grow fat’. (Fatman’s one-liner)
Fatman:
        Let’s move.

Fatman leans against the wall (position to be predetermined), wheezing. Blood
stains spread across the blast suit.

Fatman:
        My suit...

Raiden walks up to Fatman.

Fatman:
        Oh no... I’ve nothing to wear to the party...
Raiden:
        The party’s over for you.

Fatman looks up at Raiden.

Fatman:
        That’s what you think.
Raiden:
        What do you mean?

Fatman extends one hand and presses a button of some sort. An electric beep
sounds, and Raiden goes on alert.

Raiden:
        What did you just do?

Fatman smiles widely. Since his mouth is hidden, his eyes need to express the
glee.

Raiden:
        What is this?

He grabs the device from Fatman’s hand. Fatman stares at his own slender
fingers. The crimson nails flash in the sunlight.

Fatman:
        I have beautiful hands.
Fatman:
        These delicate hands can craft works of art.

Raiden removes Fatman’s collar, exposing his ugly face. From this point on,
use mouthing(tool). Raiden grills the now fading Fatman.

Raiden:
       Answer me! What the hell is this?
Fatman:
        It’s the switch for the biggest bomb in this entire place.
Raiden:
        !?

Raiden tries to destroy the controller.

Fatman:
        No use. Once it’s activated there’s no stopping the count.
Raiden:
        Where did you plant it?

Raiden looks around.

Raiden:
        Where is it?
Fatman:
        Somewhere in this area. Don’t worry, it’s very close by.

Raiden pushes the barrel of his gun against Fatman’s temple

Raiden:
        Where is it?
Fatman:
        Go ahead, shoot me. I’m already dead...
Raiden:
        Damn!
Fatman:
        Think you can find it? When it goes off, it’ll take the Big Shell
        with it.
Raiden:
        Tell me where I can find the bomb.

Fatman only smiles.

Fatman:
        That’s your problem.

He starts to laugh out loud in unadulterated glee.

Fatman:
        This is the highlight of the party. Bring it on I say. They’ll be
        happy too. (Users on their second game will understand that this
        refers to the Patriots)

Raiden rises.

Fatman:
        I die here - and start my legend. Too bad you won’t be around to see
        the movie...
Fatman:
        Laugh and grow fat!

Fatman dies, his face still wreathed in a grotesque smile.

The last of Fatman’s bombs is under his body. Raiden, having located it,
freezes the detonator with his coolant spray. Once the process is complete,
the Colonel calls in.

Colonel:
        Good work, Raiden. Looks like all the bombs are neutralized. One of
        their main leverages is now gone. That leave’s—
Raiden:
        (interrupts)Colonel, Fatman didn’t seem to know about the ransom
        demands.
Colonel:
        (lies without missing a beat) Intentionally kept in the dark, I’d
        say. He seemed to be coming from a very different place from the
        other terrorists.
Raiden:
        (not satisfied)...
Colonel:
        Raiden, a lot of hostages - our President included - are still in
        danger. Keep your mind focused on protecting them.
Raiden:
        (still not satisfied) What are my orders?
Colonel:
        Rescue the President.
Raiden:
        We have no idea where he is.
Colonel:
        You haven’t been in the central core yet. I suggest you start
        there...

Another CALL sound

Raiden:
        Wait, I have another call. Want me to take it.
Colonel:
        No, I’ll go offline. Best to keep our presence unknown.

The colonel signs off
Pliskin radios in - he is safe.

Pliskin:
        How’re you doing, kid?
Raiden:
        Pliskin!? Is everything all right?
Pliskin:
        Could be better. Looks like I was out cold for a while.
Raiden:
        How did you manage to stay alive?
Pliskin:
        Had a little help from a friend.
Raiden:
        Friend?

Snake once again changes the topic.

Pliskin:
        What about the bomb?
Raiden:
        Defused. And Fatman too.
Pliskin:
        That’s good news.
Raiden:
        How’s Shell 2?
Pliskin:
        It’s a mess. The bomb crippled Strut H.
Raiden:
        What about the toxins?
Pliskin:
        The what?
Raiden:
        If the Big Shell blows up, the explosion is expected to produce
        massive amounts of toxins...
Pliskin:
        Never heard anything about that. (The Colonel is lying in order to
        make the current situation resemble Shadow Moses)
Raiden:
        Huh?
Pliskin:
        Well, looks like there’s not much danger of that in any case. But the
        central core is starting to flood. It won’t last much longer.
Raiden:
        ...(puzzled) What about the President and the hostages?
Pliskin:
        They weren’t in Shell 2. They must be in Shell 1.
Raiden:
        We need to get the hostages out of here now.
Pliskin:
        It’s too far from Manhattan for a swim.
Raiden:
        What about lifeboats?
Pliskin:
        There doesn’t seem to be any. Doesn’t make sense.
Raiden:
        So a chopper is our only extraction?
Pliskin:
        Right. And it comes with a passenger limit. Intel has it that there
        are about thirty hostages.
Raiden:
        It’d take more than a single trip too.
Pliskin:
        We’ll have to come back.
Raiden:
        Can you pilot a chopper?
Pliskin:
        No, but I brought a gearhead with me. He’s a good guy. I’ll introduce
        you later.
Raiden:
        Pliskin, I’m on the heliport right now, but I don’t see their
        Harrier. It’s out somewhere.
Pliskin:
        We’d better move now then. Our chances with a Harrier after us are
        close to nothing.
Raiden:
        Do you know where the President is?
Pliskin:
        No. That one’s all yours.
Raiden:
        The President is at the top of our rescue list. These are our orders.
Pliskin:
        Your orders, not mine.
Raiden:
        What?
Pliskin:
        See you later.

Heliport, roof of Strut E

Raiden, having completed the bomb disposal, leaves the Heliport to search for
the President.
He is about to go down the heliport steps when the neo-ninja leaps laterally
into view. The movements are clearly those of Olga, and the scene is crafted
to remind users of the Olga encounter sequences . The Ninja’s form is similar
to the cyborg Ninja in the previous title (close to the image of the previous
Ninja/part of the S3 Plan). Fans of the previous game should believe this to
be the same character. A closer look, however, reveals different details that
mark it as a newer model. The build is androgynous rather than feminine. The
lines are not as sharp as the previous one’s since this Ninja is a full suit
type rather than the exoskeleton model.

Ninja(Olga):
        You passed with flying colors. (reference to the skills assessment
        the Patriots conducted on Raiden using Fatman, subplot.

Raiden points his gun at the strange intruder. The appearance of the Ninja is
accompanied by the faintest hint of the Lightning force SE(previous game).

Raiden:
        Identify yourself!

The Ninja draws his blade and holds it out towards Raiden. The gesture seems
more like a formal blocking move (indicating that the intent is not hostile)
rather than a prelude to an attack.

Ninja(Olga):
        I’m like you... I have no name.

The Ninja bears traces of its predecessor, such as the sensor eyes
surrounding its head. The body is bulkier, however, compared to the slim
former model, and appears to be wearing the suit rather than being a part of
it. For a second, the face shield loses its opacity and shows a glimmer of a
face (Olga). The moment passes too quickly to identify the person, but it
drives home the fact that there is a human being inside the suit.

Raiden:
        (recognizing the voice suddenly) Are you Mr. X(the tipper on the
        Codec)?
Ninja(Olga):
        If you like. But come, let’s get out of the open.

The Ninja has its guard completely down. Raiden begins to relax.

Ninja(Olga):
        Follow me.

staircase before F.O.

Raiden still has his gun in hand, but it is not pointed at the Ninja. The
Ninja’s sword is sheathed.

The Ninja rests its hands on the railings and looks at the water, back turned
to Raiden.

Raiden:
        Are you with FOXHOUND?

The Ninja turns.

Ninja(Olga):
        Neither enemy nor friend.
Ninja(Olga):
        Just a messenger from the [static of ‘Patriots’] La-Li-Lu-Le-Lo.

A burst of static obscures the word ‘Patriots’. The Ninja taps the back of it
own neck to mime the Codec (internalized communication) to Raiden. The CALL
sounds.

Ninja(Olga):
        Eavesdropping, of course.
Raiden:
        All right  why did you contact me?
Ninja(Olga):
        I’ve been ordered to give you backup, including the relaying of
        necessary intel.
Raiden:
        Ordered by whom?
Ninja(Olga):
        ...
Raiden:
        Why won’t you identify yourself?
Ninja(Olga):
        There’s no need for you to know.
Raiden:
        I’ll decide whether I need to know.
Ninja(Olga):
        You are not yet trusted to make such decisions.
Raiden:
        ...
Ninja(Olga):
        I’ll tell you something you do need to know, instead.
Ninja(Olga):
        The current location of the President.
Raiden:
        What!
Ninja(Olga):
        Or rather, the person who knows the current location of the
        President.
Raiden:
        Who is it?
Ninja(Olga):
        A Secret Service agent named Ames, currently being held with the
        other hostages.
Raiden:
        Secret Service, huh.
Ninja(Olga):
        The head of the President’s security detail. Ames has been fitted
        with the same type of VIP nanomachine system as the President. If
        you’re within range, you should be able to communicate .
Raiden:
        Why are you telling me this?
Ninja(Olga):
        Do I need to repeat myself?
Raiden:
        There’s no reason for me to believe any of this. You understand that?
Ninja(Olga):
        Of course. But you also have no choice but to believe.
Raiden:
        ...
Ninja(Olga):
        Do you have any other leads?
Raiden:
        ...where are the other hostages
Ninja(Olga):

Russian militia men (in Kevlar vests) patrol the room. Their outfits are
identical to what Raiden will receive.

Ninja(Olga):
        The hostages are being held in the conference hall  B1 conference
        hall in the Shell 1 core. You’ll find Ames there.
Raiden:
        What does he look like?
Ninja(Olga):
        We don’t know if it is indeed a he. I’ve never met this person
        either.
Raiden:
        How am I supposed to look for someone without even a description?
Ninja(Olga):
        Use your ears.
Raiden:
        What’s that supposed to mean?
Ninja(Olga):
        Ames has a pacemaker. You’ll be able to hear the machine sound in the
        heartbeat.
Raiden:
        You expect me to walk up to these hostages and listen to everyone of
        their heartbeats?
Ninja(Olga):
        The sound is too minute to detect unaided. You’d be captured
        immediately.
Raiden:
        So what am I supposed to do?

        It’s called a PAN card. It works together with your body’s own

Ninja(Olga):
        And watch yourself. The core is more heavily guarded than any other
        section of the Big Shell. You’ll get nowhere dressed like that.

The Ninja stares pointedly at Raiden’s Skull Suit. Raiden looks down at it
also, struck by the comment.

Ninja(Olga):
        Try this instead.

The Ninja tosses a suit of Russian military camo, complete with the vest to

Raiden:

Raiden stares at the cell phone ( a current, therefore old, model)

Raiden:
        What do I need a cell phone for?

He looks up to find the Ninja gone. He looks around, but there is no trace of
the Ninja. Raiden kneels down for a Codec CALL.

Raiden:
        Colonel, who was that man just now?
Colonel:
        He’s not one of ours.

The lines echo those of Naomi’s from the previous title.

Colonel:
        No  we have no one like that in our unit.
Raiden:
        (disbelieving) He said the Big Shell was housing a new model of
        Metal Gear.
Colonel:
        (trying to deflect him) First I’ve hear of it.
Raiden:
        Colonel, what are you not telling me?
Colonel:
        I’ve been completely open with you, Raiden. I’ve told you everything.
Raiden:
        Is that everything you know - or everything I need to know?
Colonel:
        Snap out of it, Raiden!
Raiden:
       ...
Colonel:
        I’ll have the Metal Gear rumor looked into. You need to contact with
        this Ames.
Raiden:
        So you believe that Ninja?
Colonel:
        Since we have no leads on the President’s current, location, we have
        no other alternatives. Right now, collect as much data as you can,
        including anything on Metal Gear.
Raiden:
        Are those my orders?
Colonel:
        Yes they are. Disguise yourself as an enemy soldier and infiltrate
        the Shell 1 core.
Raiden:
        ...Understood.

As Raiden enters the core in search of Ames, he receives a Codec CALL from
Rose.

Rose:
        Gotta minute, Jack?
Raiden:
        Rose?
Rose:
        I found some information on where Solid Snake is interred.
Raiden:
        Great. Shoot.
Rose:
        I’ve located the gave site.
Raiden:
        And the body?
Rose:
        Exhumed for DNA testing.
Raiden:
        Well? Do you have the results?
Rose:
        The right arm was missing, but there was no doubt that it was him.
        That body belongs to Solid Snake.

Raiden, somewhat of a fan of Snake, is disappointed.

Raiden:
        Hmm... So the head of the terrorist group must be --
Rose:
        An imposter.
Raiden:
        Right... (disappointment)
Rose:
        You sound disappointed.
Raiden:
        I guess —- I guess I was kind of hoping to meet the legend
        in the flesh.
Rose:
        I get you. But it looks like he’s not behind this incident.
Colonel:
        Raiden, the President needs you, I think.
Colonel:
        Disguise yourself as enemy personnel and infiltrate the core section.
        Your priority is to contact Agent Ames.

Raiden enters the core dressed as an enemy militia man in search of Ames.
He exits the elevator cautiously and moves out to the corridor. He senses
other men ahead and once again ducks halfway into the elevator. A Gurlukovich
militia man (sand Kevlar vest) is standing in front of the conference hall
door, leaning in to have his iris scanned by a biometrics sensor (monitor)
installed on the wall. Once the sensor has captured the pattern of the man’s
iris and matched it to a database entry, a computerized voice announced
the result.

Computer:
        Retinal pattern recognized. You are cleared to enter.

Once the announcement has been made, the door(sliding) is unlocked. The man
walks inside.

Shell 1 B1 Conference Hall

Raiden infiltrates the conference hall located in B1, the Shell 1 Core,
dressed as an enemy militia man. His objective is to make contact with Ames,
who is a prisoner inside the room.
Raiden is dressed in a Gurlukovich militia uniform. He enters the conference
hall, his blue eyes staring out of the ski mask eye holes. He looks down to
the floor below and sees the mass of hostages. The view gives the users a
basic grasp of the size and layout of the space, as well as the number and
general state of the hostages. However, there is no way to tell where Ames
is.

P040_01_P01 Ames discovery 1 polygon demo 1 (MC)
Conference Hall, Shell 1 B1

Raiden, disguised as an enemy soldier, looks for Ames in a conference hall
full of hostages.
When Raiden places the directional microphone on one man’s chest, he hears a
high-pitched electronic tone from the pacemaker. He looks at the man again,
and puts away the microphone in favor of the AK.

Raiden:
        You must be Ames.

Ames cocks his head, unsure of the speaker’s intent. He can clearly hear, if
not see. Raiden lowers his voice further, wary of being unmasked.

Raiden:
        Keep still and listen to me.

He moves his face closer to the man’s ear.

Raiden:
        I’m not a terrorist. I got in here using one of their uniforms.

The man is clearly still on guard, half-doubtful.

Raiden:
        I’m taking off the tape. Stay quiet.

The man nods slightly, and Raiden removes the tape across his mouth. The man
takes deep, greedy gulps of air.

Man:
        Who told you about me?
Raiden:
        An informer calling himself Mr. X, dressed like a Ninja.
Man:
        I see. (that it’s not a trap)

Upon hearing the code word Mr. X, the man relaxes.

Man:
        Take this thing off me, will you...

Raiden removes the blindfold. The man looks at Raiden, eyes narrowed against
the sudden brightness.

Man:
        I’m Richard Ames.
Raiden:
        Secret Service.
Ames:
        No —- I was sent in by the La-Li-Lu-Le-Lo, just like you.
Raiden:
        What? (confused)

AV control room, northern block of the conference hall

Change scene to the communication control studio on the north side of the
hall. Ocelot sits there, intently monitoring the conversation between Raiden
and Ames with the help of a surveillance camera/mike. Solidus and Olga have
yet to arrive in the studio.

Conference Hall, Shell 1 B1

Back to Raiden and Ames

Ames:
        You’re here to find out where the President is.
Ames:
        We have little time , so I’ll be brief. How about switching to
        nanomachines first?
Raiden:
        Nanomachine communication?
Ames:
        Right. Silence beats talk when it comes to safety.

AV control room, northern block of the conference hall.

Back to the communication control studio on the Northern side of the hall.
The incoming visuals remain the same, but the voices have ceased. Raiden and
Ames stand regarding each other, but their lips are not moving.

Ocelot:

Ocelot clicks his tongue in impatience, deprived of a chance to eavesdrop.

To Ames discovery 2 Codec demo 1 (Ames internal)



P040_02_R02 Ames discovery 2 Codec demo 1 (Ames internal)
Codec screen

Ames:
        Are you on?
Raiden:
        Right here.

The President had allied himself with Solidus and launched a campaign of
attack against the ‘Patriots’. He was betrayed and is now a prisoner. Ames
was originally sent in as a spy after the Patriots sensed the President’s
intent.

Raiden:
        Do you really know where the President is?
Ames:
        Almost certainly. He was moved to the first floor of Shell 2’s core
        section.
Raiden:
        The first floor, the core of Shell 2...(a repetition for the user’s
        benefit)
Raiden:
        Is he still there?
Ames:
        I don’t know. I can’t get a response. The President is in a
        reinforced room designed to block out all signals. (More later)
Raiden:
        You don’t think he’s been  like the other hostages...(killed)?
Ames:
        ?
Raiden:
        A hostage was killed in retaliation after the SEAL Team 10 disasters,
        remember?
Ames:
        What are you talking about?
Raiden:
        ...? (More evidence of the Colonel’s lies)
Ames:
        Regardless of what they do to the other hostages, they won’t touch
        the President.
Raiden:
        What makes you so sure?
Ames:
        The case.
Raiden:
        You mean the nuclear button they took?
Ames:
        Right. And the case won’t do anything by itself.
Ames:
        That case may be the single most advanced example of a weapons
        failsafe system. The password is nothing less than the physiological
        data of the U.S. President.
Raiden:
        Physiological data?
Ames:
        The President’s own vital signs - heartbeat, brainwave pattern,
        blood pressure and so on  are constantly monitored and relayed by
        his internal nanomachines. This information along with the DNA
        pattern serve as a biometric password, unbreakable even by the latest
        parallel processor super computers.
Ames:
        The password entry itself cannot be performed unless brainwave
        patterns and heartbeats fall within normal parameters, rendering
        chemical and other forms of coercion impractical. In other words, the
        log in must be made of the President’s own free will.
Ames:
        As a failsafe, the input must also be reconfirmed hourly, even after
        the initial login. If a valid confirmation is not forthcoming, the
        system will automatically cancel the login.
Raiden:
        And that’s why they can’t harm the President...
Ames:
        -- at least until the bird flies.
Raiden:
        Is there really a new model of Metal Gear here?
Ames:
        Absolutely. The Black Case serves as the launch key to the Metal Gear
        as well.
Raiden:
        Why would they hide a Metal Gear in an offensive plant?
Ames:
        ? (Hint of suspicion - any ally of the Patriots should know this
        already) haven’t they told you anything?
Raiden:
        ...
Ames:
        The entire thing was planned - the oil spill, the tanker accident
        that caused it, everything. The Big Shell was built specifically for
        the development of a new Metal Gear model. The inspection tour was to
        check its progress...
Raiden:
        (his suspicions have been confirmed; Angry, full of questions) What’s
        going on around here...
Ames:
        Wait!

Back to the conference hall. Solidus (figure wearing a coat) walks into the
studio. Raiden and Ames are still communicating internally, and their lips
are closed.

Ames:
        Here comes Snake.

Ames indicates the studio with a look. The etched glass makes it difficult
to see in.

Raiden:
        That’s him?

The silhouette is not unlike that of Snake. Ocelot closes the blinds on the
window once Solidus is in the room, shutting it out of outside view.

Ames:
        Use the microphone to listen in.

P040_04_I04 Ames discovery 4 interactive first-person demo 1
Conference Hall, Sell 1 B1

Raiden listens in on Solidus and the others using the directional mic.
Automatically switch to first-person screen, with the mic in one hand. Pan
the perspective with the right, left, up, down arrows. The volume of Solidus
conversation changes with the direction of the mic; even with the mic turned
completely off, the conversation is somewhat audible. No other keystrokes
will work for the duration of the demo, much like in the torture sequences in
the previous title. If the mic is pointed in the wrong direction, the user
will miss hearing the dialogue below. Solidus’ and Ocelot’s respective
positions accurately represented by means of voice volumes. This serves to
increase the immersiveness of ‘listening in’ for the player. The subtitle
readability(alpha brightness) should match the volume; lower the volume, the
lighter the subtitle. Pointing the mic at Ocelot will result in his voice
being louder. When Olga enters the room, the panning from left to right grows
considerably. As a result, the user is forced to move the mic depending on
who is speaking. If the mic is pointed in a completely wrong direction during
this time, Ames’ lines become audible. Point the mic at Ames, and the volume
grows louder.

Ames:
        Make sure you catch their conversation! Point the microphone at them!
Ames:
        Point the mic in their direction.
Ames:
        Point the microphone at them.
Ames:
        Can you hear anything like that?
Ames:
        Where are you pointing that thing?
Ames:
        Not this way. Point it at them.

Pause the dialogue inside of the studio during this time. Because of the
blinds, the inside of the studio is not visible.

Ocelot:
        King --

He calls Soildus ‘King’.

Ocelot:
        Fatman is dead.

Solidus seems unmoved. He is still only a silhouette, his expression in
the shadows.

Solidus:
        It doesn’t matter. Saved us the trouble of getting rid of him
        ourselves?
Ocelot:
        Why did he betray us?
Solidus:
        Who knows? They’ve a band of lunatics to begin with. Nothing they do
        should come as a surprise.
Ocelot:
        I’ll have his background rechecked, just in case.
Solidus:
        ...You think he was working for them(‘Patriots’)?
Ocelot:
        We can’t discount the possibility. Especially with that intruder
        still at large.
Solidus:
        Yes... the man in the Sneaking Suit.
Ocelot:
        You know more about those suits than I do.
Solidus:
        But FOXHOUND was disbanded 4 years ago. So it must be the Patriots.

The word ‘Patriots’ finally makes an appearance.

Solidus:
        What about the damage to Shell 2?
Ocelot:
        The circulation system for the contaminated water has been damaged.
        The water being drawn in is overflowing, and the lower block of the
        central core is flooding.
Solidus:
        Seal the connecting pathways between Shells 1 + 2.
Ocelot:
        The Semtex and IR sensors are already in place.
Solidus:
        Any effect on - it? (reference to the new Metal Gear = Arsenal Gear)
Ocelot:
        No.
Solidus:
        What bout the President?
Ocelot:
        The password entry has already been made to the Black Case. In one
        hour, we’ll need a confirmation from him. His work is done after
        that.
Solidus:
        Make sure you keep him alive until then (as to impress the fact on
        him once again).
Ocelot:
        Yes, I know.
Solidus:
        What about the unit’s activation? (reference to AG)
Ocelot:
        Almost complete. The code has already been entered. All we need now
        is for the girl to start the system.
Solidus:
        The usual method, I assume?
Ocelot:
        No - the drugs(artificially synthesized phenolbaribtol) took care of
        everything...
Solidus:
        Hmm...

Solidus turns his back on Ocelot and says reflectively:

Solidus:
        Only a dew more steps to Outer Heaven...

Olga opens the doors and walks in (sound). Olga is also just a silhouette,
but the reader should be able to identify her because of their former
encounter with her.

Olga:
        What is that cyborg Ninja, Shalashaska(Ocelot)?
Ocelot:
        I cannot even guess...
Olga:
        What about you (to Solidus)?
Solidus:
        I’m having that matter looked into.
Ocelot:
        Olga! Don’t cast suspicion where it isn’t due!
Olga:
        Where it isn’t due? When you watched my father die and did nothing.
Ocelot:
        It’s been two years, Olga. Let it go.

Olga says sarcastically to Ocelot:

Olga:
        I read the case file for Shadow Moses, by the way.
Ocelot:
        Olga, how could you suspect me?
Olga:
        I know that the Ninja’s not one of MY men.
Ocelot:
        How meaningful you make that sound. If Sergei were still alive--
Olga:
        If the old man were still alive, I wouldn’t need to take orders from
        you.
Ocelot:
        Olga, Sergei was my best friend... (as though starting an old story)

Olga jabs her gun against Ocelot.

Olga:
        If you sell us out  I’ll kill you myself.

Ocelot pulls his own gun with his left hand and pushes the barrel against her
chest.

Ocelot:
        Listen, daughter of Sergei. Don’t ever let me see your gun pointed at
        me again.

Olga puts her gun away.

Olga:
        If you wish. I’ll put a bullet in your back instead.

Ocelot twirls his gun and returns it to the holster.

Ocelot:
        (Sniff)
Solidus:
        Stop this infighting!
Solidus:
        I took you both in when no one else would.
Solidus:
        You think any government would have you as irregulars in this
        political climate? The worst kind of wetworks, maybe. But that’s even
        doubtful.

He talks soothingly to Ocelot and Olga.

Solidus:
        I’d recommend against switching camps - you’ve nowhere left to go.

Ocelot looks down in assent.

Olga:
        (hiss)

She leaves the room

During the conversation, Ocelot’s right arm starts to move convulsively, and
points the barrel of his gun straight at his own temple.

Ocelot:
        U-urgh!!
Solidus:
        It’s happening again?
Ocelot:
        This damn right arm - Liquid!

Ocelot tries to restrain the runaway arm in vain. During the fit, 2 distinct
heartbeats can be heard from Ocelot. One belongs to Liquid. Most users will
not understand what is going on from just the sound and the voices, but
veterans of the Tanker Chapter should recognize the fit.

Ocelot:
        It’s almost as if it’s having it’s revenge --!!
Solidus:
        How much do you think we spent on that arm in Cyan. The best
        transplant surgery team in the world --
Ocelot:
        I never trust a Frenchman.

Ocelot injects tranquillizer into his won arm (sound of injection) and
manages to bring it under control. The hiss of hypodermic injection.

Ocelot:
        There’s something going on. The incidents are becoming more
        frequent... Maybe that man’s presence... (flag of Snake’s ****)
Solidus:
        Ocelot, I’ll leave this place in your hands. I have the intruder to
        take care of.
Ocelot:
        Yes, King.

Raiden:
        They said the password input was complete...
Ames:
        I though so...
Raiden:
        You said the password entry into the Black Case had to be made by the
        President willingly.
Ames:
        That’s right.
Raiden:
        So this means the President is cooperating with them?
Ames:
        It would have to be, yes.
Raiden:
        Why?
Ames:
        Probably tired of being a puppet. But it wasn’t a smart move to
        betray us...
Raiden:
        ...a puppet?
Ames:
        We’re running out of time. They WILL fire a nuke. You know what you
        need to do(= kill the President) before then. (Ames believes Raiden
        to be an assassin that the Patriots sent in to clean up the
        situation.)
Raiden:
        Fire the nuke? But it’s nowhere close to the ransom deadline.
Ames:
        Ransom?
Raiden:
        Thirty billion dollars in cash?
Ames:
        What are you babbling about? The nuclear strike is not a threat -
        it’s been the objective all along!
Raiden:
        They plan to slaughter millions of people!?
Ames:
        No - a high altitude detonation. You’ve heard of the Compton Effect?
Raiden:
        Total disruption of electronic equipment by EMMA pulse.
Ames:
        Textbook answer. Well, when an average nuclear warhead goes off
        within the atmosphere, the result is an electromagnetic pulse of up
        to 50 billion megawatts. The EMMA field can reach tens of thousands
        of volts per meter, and most electronic equipment will be toast in an
        instant. And this is what they plan to do over Manhattan.
Raiden:
        The New York Stock Exchange...
Ames:
        -- will suffer the same fate.
Raiden:
        If one of the key movers of world economy stops functioning, it could
        mean the beginning of a global depression. Black Monday will look
        like a picnic in comparison.
Ames:
        But that isn’t their aim. What they plan to do is to ‘liberate’
        Manhattan, pull it offline, and turn it into some kind of republic.
Ames:
        Hence ‘Sons of Liberty’, I suppose.
Raiden:

Ames grows anxious at the sight of Ocelot leaving the studio.

Ames:
        Search my right pocket. Hurry!

Raiden searched the pocket, and finds a security card.

Ames:
        It’s a security card. You’ll be able to unlock doors up to Level 3
        security. Use it to get to Shell 2.

Raiden puts away Card 3.

Ames:

Real-time game. The player must switch the mic for the AK before Ocelot
arrives. Change to the first person view. The perspective can pan, but the
user cannot move away from the spot. If Raiden fails to switch to the AK
before Ocelot arrives, Raiden will be unmasked and the game is over.

Ocelot:
        Who are you?

A soldier comes running at Ocelot’s voice.

Enemy Soldier:
        Show your face!

Attacking Ocelot or trying to run will likewise result in a game over.

Ames has already been relieved of his blindfold and gag(tape). Raiden moves
slightly away from Ames, keeping his eyes on Ocelot and the militia man.

Ocelot:
        What do you think you’re doing?

Ames speaks up to cover Raiden:

Ames:
        I asked him to remove these. I’m ill, you see.

Ocelot knows Ames is lying.

Ocelot:
        I always knew that the DIA turned out second-rate liars.
Ames:
        W-what are you talking about?

Ames tries to bluff.

Ocelot:
        No need for denials. We know what you are - Colonel Ames.

Ames stands frozen (having believed his cover story to be foolproof). He does
not know that Ocelot is also allied with the Patriots.
Ocelot pulls his revolver out. Raiden is faced with a dilemma.

Ocelot:
        They (Patriots) knew that the President was planning to betray them.
        So they sent you in to keep tabs on him, am I right?
Ames:
        You --!
Ocelot:
        Sorry, Colonel. You failed to carry out your duties.

Ames with nothing to lose, says aggressively:

Ames:
        You’ll never escape the La-Li-Lu-Le-Lo 

Ocelot twirls the revolver in his left hand.

Ocelot:
        Is that so?

Ocelot points the revolver at Ames, but before he can pull the trigger, Ames
starts to claw at his chest in agony. Raiden moves a few steps away from
Ames. His convulsions, as well as the scene in general, is very like the
DARPA chief’s death scene in the last game.

Ocelot is taken aback.

Ocelot:
        What the --?

Ames turns to Raiden (Russian soldier) and manages to gasp out:

Ames:
        Y-you tricked me...

Ames turns to Ocelot agonizingly and utters his last words:

Ames:
        I understand now --  Ocelot... you’re --

Meaning, you’re one of us. Ames dies.
The cause of the death is a heart attack brought on by nanomachine-induced
pacemaker malfunction. (A calculated act by the Patriots). Raiden stands by,
stunned. He moves in closer to try to help. Ocelot notices the unusual
behavior and rakes Raiden from head to toe with his gaze. Only Raiden’s deep
blue eyes are visible, through the ski mask’s eye slit.

Ocelot:
        You - which team are you with?
Raiden:
        ...
Ocelot:
        Show your face!

The militia man steps up to Raiden and aims his weapon.

Ocelot:
        You know who he is?

The man, his gun still aimed at Raiden, replies:

Enemy Soldier:
        No. He’s not one of mine.

Raiden stays still.

Ocelot:
        Identify yourself!

Ocelot pulls off the ski mask, and Raiden’s blonde hair falls out. The ski
mask dangles from Ocelot’s hand.

Ocelot:
        Hm, we meet at last...

Ocelot points the revolver at Raiden’s brow. Raiden stares ahead stoically,
resignation in his eyes. But, suddenly, the Ninja materializes overhead. The
Ninja’s sword is almost on Ocelot’s left arm before the latter manages to
swing it out of the way.
The Ninja stands in front of Raiden. The militia man fires a burst at the
Ninja with his AK, but the Ninja’s blade deflects the bullets. The rounds
ricochet away, and several of them find the hostages.
The cry of the hostages. Ocelot restrains the soldiers.

Hostage A:
        (Scream muffled by the gag)!
Hostage B:
        (Scream muffled by the gag)!
Hostage C:
        (Scream muffled by the gag)!
Hostage D:
        (Scream muffled by the gag)!

Ocelot:
        Hold your fire! We need the hostages alive!

Then men stop firing.

Ninja(Olga):
        Hurry! Get away!

The Ninja moves forward.

Ocelot:
        You? But you died!?

Ocelot retreats. An assault team, in the meantime is rushing out of the 1F
glassed room (in the back). Raiden runes up the stairs and heads for the
security door. The soldiers aim for Raiden and fire. The ninja leaps up to
the second floor and moves into position in front of the door.

Ninja(Olga):
        Leave this to me!

Raiden manages to clear the door and enters the corridor.

Raiden saved by the Ninja, makes his way to the B1 corridor. Since he had
already been spotted, he cannot reenter the hostage room, and has no choice
but to go to another floor using the elevator.. Once out in the corridor, the
general alert regarding Raiden’s presence can be heard on the P.A. system.
For some reason, there is no mention of the Ninja.

Raiden:
        Colonel, Ames is dead. Looked like a heart attack.
Colonel:
        Hm, that’s unfortunate. However, we do at last know where the
        President is.
Raiden:
        ...(suspicious) So there really is a new type of Metal Gear in this
        place --?
Colonel:
        Apparently. We’re still looking into it...
Raiden:
        I’ve also been told that the nuclear strike was what the terrorists
        were after from the start. NOT the thirty billion dollars!
Colonel:

Raiden:
        Colonel! What are you keeping from me!
Colonel:
        (flaring up) I am not keeping back anything! It’s not as though I’m
        told all the facts either!
Raiden:
        ...
Colonel:
        I’m pulling in all the favors I can to look into all this. Just be a
        little patient.
Colonel:
        Our priority should be with the President right now. We can take it
        that they’ve completed the password entry and are preparing Metal
        Gear for nuclear strike. Get to the President as soon as possible.
Raiden:
        But the President is cooperating with them --
Colonel:
        According to Ames, yes. But it’s also true that they’re about to get
        rid of the President. There’s something else going on here, and the
        President may be able to tell you what it is when you see him in
        person.
Raiden:
        ...(Might use What...? instead.)
Colonel:
        Once they get the confirmation for the nuclear launch, they’ll do it.
        You need to rescue the President before then.
Raiden:
        ...
Rose:
        Jack, I agree with the Colonel. You need to protect the President for
        now.
Raiden:

(mandatory Pliskin CALL)
Codec screen

Having shaken off enemy pursuit, Raiden heads for the central section of
Shell 2 in a bid to rescue the President. When we reaches the connecting
bridge between the two Shells, he receives a radio call from Pliskin.

Pliskin:
        Raiden, can you hear me?
Raiden:
        Pliskin? Where have you been?
Pliskin:
        Checking around. I’m in the Strut H right now. How’s the situation
        over there? (He has been researching the plant as well as Emma’s
        location. He will tell Raiden later about the absence of toxic
        substances from the plant)
Raiden:
        We have a lead on the President’s location.
Pliskin:
        Where is he?
Raiden:
        Shell 2 core, the first floor.
Pliskin:
        I’m cut off from the core where I am.
Raiden:
        All right. I’m on my way to Shell 2 right now.
Pliskin:
        There are IR sensors in place on the connecting bridge between Shells
        1 and 2. If you break the beams, the Semtex will go off.
Raiden:
        Yeah, I heard them talking about that.
Pliskin:
        Target the control units and destroy them. Make sure you don’t shoot
        the Semtex.
Raiden:
        What about the coolant spray?
Pliskin:
        They’re not stupid. The Semtex is on the other side of the railing,
        out of reach.
Raiden:
        What do the control units look like?
Pliskin:
        Take a look with your binoculars.

Raiden follows Pliskin’s advice and successfully neutralizes the IR trap. He
then receives a Codec CALL fro Pliskin.

Pliskin:
        Raiden, I found us a ride.
Raiden:
        I’m all ears.
Pliskin:
        One of the enemy’s Kasatkas (transport choppers)
Raiden:
        Is it in good shape?
Pliskin:
        Full tank. I’m heading for Shell 1 now. What about the Harrier?
Raiden:
        It’s not on the heliport here.
Pliskin:
        Good. I’ll set this one down there then.
Raiden:
        Can you cover the hostages? They’re being held on the first floor of
        the core.
Raiden:
        Pliskin, you didn’t happen to find any other places where hostages
        were being held, did you?
Pliskin:
        No - nothing like that.
Raiden:
       Ok... (another proof that the Colonel is lying)
Pliskin:
        How many hostages are there?
Raiden:
        A few short of thirty. One dead, and several wounded.
Pliskin:
        The Kasatka’s cargo area will hold 13 max.
Raiden:
        What about the other Kasatka?
Pliskin:
        I sabotaged it. It can’t come after us if it can’t get off the
        ground.
Raiden:
        Oh. (disappointed)
Pliskin:
        We’ll have to make two trips.
Raiden:
        Can you fly the Kasatka?
Pliskin:
        I have a pilot who’s flown the civilian model, the KA-62, in VR.
        There’s not a whole lot of difference between the military KA-60 and
        the civilian model.

        Colonel, I need some answers from you. Who exactly is Pliskin and his

Colonel:
        I know what you’re thinking.
Raiden:
        It keeps coming back to Shadow Moses. And now this Otacon...
Rose:
        AKA Hal Emmerich, Ph.D. A Shadow Moses survivor.
Raiden:
        Rose?
Rose:
        Snake and Otacon both became fugitives after Shadow Moses, wanted for
        acts of terrorism.
Raiden:
        An anti-Metal Gear organization...
Colonel:
        They sabotaged and destroyed countless Metal Gear units throughout
        the world...
Rose:
        And were responsible for the incident two years ago that necessitated
        the construction of the Big Shell.
Raiden:
        Snake and his partner aren’t terrorists.
Rose:
        Jack, why are you defending them?
Raiden:
        I look back on what I’ve done here so far - and things like training
        and sense of duty alone won’t get you through a sneaking mission like
        this.
Rose:
        Jack, are you okay?
Raiden:
        You need something - higher. I can’t think of the right word, but...
        it has to be pure will, backed up by - by courage, or ideals, or
        something like that.
Raiden:
        I’d stake my life on it. The Solid Snake that saved Shadow Moses
        couldn’t turn into a terrorist.
Colonel:
        Maybe that’s true, but they went down with that tanker two years ago.
        We even recovered Snake’s body.
Raiden:
        And the DNA test results on that body ay it’s him.
Rose:
        Jack, I know what you’re saying, but Snake is dead. He can’t be here,
        not even as this Dr. Hal Emmerich.
Raiden:
        But that also means he can’t be the terrorist leader behind this
        thing.

Connecting bridge between Shells 1 and 2

Raiden clears the IR sensors and is crossing the connecting bridge, on his
way to Shell 2. He becomes aware of the sound of a chopper taking off from
Shell 2 (propeller noise), and looks up. A Kasatka is rising skyward from
behind the bulk of Shell 2. The chopper hovers of the bridge, and Pliskin
waves from the open cargo hold. Raiden watches as the helicopter heads for
the Shell 1 heliport. When Raiden returns his gaze to Shell 2, there is a man
standing in front of the access door. He wears a shiny outer garment (long
leather coat). Raiden tries to get a better look, but the sun is in his eyes.
What little he can see of the wavering image is that of a wiry, well-built
man. Play a SE consisting of a list of American President’s recited mantra-
style during this Solidus entrance scene.

Man:
        I’ve been waiting for you! A messenger from the Patriots!

Solidus, taking a closer look at Raiden mutters:

Man:
        Where do I know him from? (reference to the subplot where Solidus
        raised Raiden as a child soldier)

Raiden recalls the man in the studio of the hostage holding room.

Raiden:
        So you’re the boss around here?

Man:
        No, not just around here. I’m the Boss to surpass Big Boss himself...
        Solid Snake.
Pliskin:
        NO! That is NOT Solid Snake!

Pliskin’s voice reaches them over the drone of the propellers. The Kasatka
has returned instead of leading to Shell 1. The man’s coat ripples in the
wind. Pliskin is leaning out of the chopper. The man gazes at him, his own
face still invisible to Raiden.

Man:
        What a pleasant surprise - brother.
Pliskin:
        Save it. You’re no brother of mine.
Man:
        Don’t say you’re forgotten me - Snake.

The man moves his face out of the shadow. Solidus has the face that’s both
Pliskin’s(Snake of the Tanker Chapter) and Big Boss’(hair, moustaches and
goatee of the Big Boss).

Raiden:
        Snake?

Raiden, caught between two Snakes, is bewildered.

Snake:
        Raiden, take cover!

Snake leans further out of the chopper and fires a burst from his M4. Raiden
ducks behind the core structure.

Solidus:
        (sharp exhale)

Solidus activates the accelerator and speeds away(booooom). The leather coat
burns up in an instant. The M4 round that Snake fired find the Shell 2 access
door instead. The vapor from the coat clears to reveal a muscle-suited
Solidus (muscles still off). Solidus’ reappearance has a ‘time travel’ feel,
and the space in which he materialized looks warped. On the ground is a fiery
tracing of his accelerated travel (the accelerator leaves a ‘Back to the
Future’ esque flame pattern). Solidus’ face is finally visible. The hair
style and the facial hair are conscious attempts to model himself after the
Big Boss (since the share the same genes). By the same token, he has a
striking resemblance to Snake.

Snake:
        (seeing Solidus’ face) Stop impersonating him (Big Boss)!

He aims the M4 again. This time Solidus uses his elbow shield to deflect the
bullets. Sparks fly from the shield, (a la ‘Wonder Woman’).

Solidus:
        Brother, I’m a whole different game from Liquid.

Snake abandons the M4 in favor of a grenade launcher.
Solidus sees this and switches his muscle suit on.

Solidus:
        HRRRRRR!!

As Solidus lets out a yell, the suit starts to swell out rapidly. The snake
hands are not yet activated. Snake fires a grenade at Solidus (door area).
Solidus snaps the steel collars closed with a crash and takes a battle
stance. Once again, he moves out of the way using the accelerator, and the
grenade strikes the door. (Destroying it in the process. The door cannot be
opened after this point.)

Raiden:
        Oof!
Solidus:
        That the best you can do, Snake!

Snake takes aim once again and fires the grenade launcher. Solidus jumps off
the bridge just as the explosion takes place.

Snake:
        Did I get him?

Snake stares at the point at which Solidus vanished. The blast knocks Raiden
to the ground. Suddenly, a Harrier 2 appears from below on a steep ascent. On
its nose cone stands Solidus.

Snake:
        Otacon, we’re in trouble! It’s the Harrier!

Otacon brings the chopper around quickly. Solidus calls out to Snake:

Solidus:
        The world needs only one Big Boss!

Solidus deactivates the artificial muscles, and quickly slips into the
tandem-seated (back seat) cockpit.

Solidus:
        I’ll drown you fools for interfering.

The Harrier fires a missile at the chopper. Otacon manages to dodge the
projectile, but just barely. The missile destroys the door of Strut D
instead. The Harrier swoops over Strut D. The Kasatka hovers over the
connecting bridge (low altitude). Snake leans out and shouts to Raiden, who
has managed to get back on his feet.

Snake:
        Raiden, this is the Stinger missile launcher!

An item (Stinger launcher) is dropped from the chopper onto the bridge. God
to Item BOX

Snake:
        The Kasatka can’t stand up to the Harrier!

The missiles (BOX) is dropped following the line.

Snake:
        You have to shoot the Harrier down!

The additional missiles fall through the hole in the center and land on the
lower level. Otacon swears at the Harrier as it turns towards them.

Otacon:
        Snake, we’ve got company!

The chopper ascends rapidly.

Snake:
        I’m counting on you!

The Kasatka moves to a fairly high altitude.

Connecting bridge between Shells 1 and 2

Raiden succeeds in shooting the Harrier down with advice from Snake in the
chopper. The Harrier hits the Strut G section of the connecting bridge during
the course of its fall. The bridge is heavily damaged, and Strut G sags to
the let. The Harrier starts a free fall, completely out of control. As it
dives past Raiden’s eyes, he can see the rage-filled face of Solidus in the
cockpit.
Just as the plane is about to hit the ocean’s surface, the water haves
upward. Snake, from his perch in the Kasatka sees a giant shadow under the
surface.

Snake:
        There’s something coming up!

Metal Gear RAY (head portion) breaks through the waves and appears before
them. The RAY catches the Harrier in its jaws and saves it.

Raiden:
        That’s Metal Gear!? It’s already active! (He believes RAY to be the
new model of Metal Gear he has heard about.)

The RAY (prototype, manned model) fires numerous pursuit-type missiles
(multiple warhead type) from pods on its back, the Harrier still in its jaws.
The missiles land on the bridge as well as Struts G and F and explode with
terrible force. One of them detonates close to the Kasatka. Raiden slides
down the side (railing) of Shell 2, and grabs hold of the railing at the last
moment. The railing bends under his weight and drops with him for another
several feet. Snake and Otacon’s Kasatka veers away toward Shell 1, trailing
smoke.

RAY has a firm grip on the Harrier.

Solidus opens the cockpit. One eye has been badly damaged and he is bleeding
from the socket. Solidus wipes the wound with his hand, utterly unmoved.

Solidus:
        They got my eye (happily).

Vamp follows him out of the cockpit where he had been sitting in the front
(pilot’s) of the tandem seats. Solidus calls out toward the

Solidus:
        Vamp - go!

Solidus gestures to Vamp. The latter has been shot in the side by Raiden (at
the entrance-level pool). Vamp grins and leaps down to the ocean. Meanwhile,
the chopper has struggled onto the heliport after a strappingly low flight. A
look down from the cockpit reveals Raiden painfully climbing up from the
railing onto the tilted bridge.
Vamp runs lightly across the water. The surface is aflame, the oil slick
still burning. Vamp seems not to even notice, and continues to charge ahead.

Otacon:
        Hey, what’s that --?
Snake:
        It’s running on water...!

Raiden leans out and gets a look at Vamp, now running under the chopper. He
reaches Strut L and zooms up the ladder (in a perpendicular stance) like a
spider speeding up a wall.
RAY, still gripping the Harrier, disappears form view in a matter of seconds.

Snake:
        Raiden, are you all right?
Raiden:
        Yeah. How about you guys?
Snake:
        Barely managed, but we’re all right.
Raiden:
        The chopper?
Snake:
        We need some time for repairs.
Raiden:
        Oh...
Snake:
        The President’s all yours.
Raiden:
        OK... Can I ask you something?
Snake:
        What?
Raiden:
        Are you THE Snake?
Snake:
      ...
Raiden:
        They said you were dead...
Snake:
        No, not me. There are still to many things I need to do.
Raiden:
        Snake, you’re a legend - and that’s why I need to ask you this.
Snake:
        Legend?
Snake:
        A legend is nothing but fiction. Someone tells it, someone else
        remembers, everybody passes it on.
Raiden:
        I’m here because I was assigned to this mission, not because I want
        to. If I could, I’d be out of here in a second.
Snake:
        ...
Raiden:
        Look. How could you come back to all this? Why keep fighting?
Snake:
        There’s something my best friend said to me once. (lines from the
        Ninja [Grey Fox] ion the last game)
Raiden:
        ...
Snake:
        We’re not tools of the government or anybody else. Fighting was the
        only thing I was good at, but... At least I always fought for what I
        believed in...
Raiden:
        What about - what about the DNA results from that body?
Otacon:
        That was Liquid’s body. He and Snake are identical on
        the genetic level.
Raiden:
        Liquid.
Otacon:
        A deception - for our own protection.
Otacon:
        We stole his frozen body from some organization. Kind of a hassle
        though...
Snake:
        That’s all there is to it.
Raiden:
        ...
Raiden:
        Are you two really an NGO?
Otacon:
        Insofar as we’re a nonprofit organization of civilians advocating a
        cause, yes. The cause happens to be the eradication of Metal Gear.
Snake:
        We work on our own. But it’s a cause worth fighting for.
Raiden:
        Why would you stick your neck out for something this risky?
Snake:
        That’s the way I used to look at it, four years ago.
Snake:
        I was holed up in the middle of nowhere in Alaska, drinking too much.
Otacon:
        We have a responsibility to the coming generations, to the world.
Raiden:
        What responsibility?
Otacon:
        To keep tack of the mistakes we’ve made as a species.
Snake:
        We need to remember --  to spread the word - to fight for change.
        And that’s what keeps me alive.
Raiden:
        You think you can change the future?
Snake:
        I’m not as arrogant as that.
Raiden:
        What you do isn’t grassroots activism. It’s more like terrorism.
Snake:
        I admit that...
Otacon:
        But our group, Philanthropy, received some information: A new Metal
        Gear prototype was being developed here and, terrorists were planning
        to raid the facility. The info came from a very reliable source.
Raiden:
        So you’re here to...
Otacon:
        We’re here to stop all that, but I also have a personnel motive.
Snake:
        Looks like the terrorists have his sister in the Big Shell.
Snake:
        We’re here on our own, not under anyone’s orders. We have our own
        battles. Otacon’s here for someone - I’m not.
Raiden:
        This is a military mission.

Switch frequencies.

Rose:
        Jack? Are you all right?
Raiden:
        Just barely.
Rose:
        You almost gave me a heart attack...
Raiden:
        Sorry. Wasn’t intentional.
Rose:
        I know that. And I know I need to stay stronger.
Raiden:
        Say a prayer for me, Rose. So I can come back.
Rose:
        You will make it back. I’m with you all the way, remember...
Raiden:
        That means a lot to me, you know.
Rose:
        I’m going to save the data, okay, Jack?

Select either Save or Don’t Save.

Raiden:
        Colonel, another Metal Gear’s already gone active...

(let Raiden and the user’s believe that RAY is the new Metal Gear model! RAY
is the one that Ocelot stole off the tanker earlier, and has been in
commission since then.)

Colonel:
        It’s not too late. You can still prevent a nuclear strike by securing
        the President and preventing the password confirmation from taking
        place.
Colonel:
        Get to the President. He’s in the core section of Shell 2.
Rose:
        I’m checking the satellite images... Looks like you can get to the
        core from the other side of Strut L.
Colonel:
        The core hasn’t gone under yet from what we can tell. Follow the
        railings down, then jump onto the pipe.
Rose:
        The only viable Strut in the outer perimeter is L. That attack just
        now, doesn’t make any sense  it’s like they have no more use for
        this place.
Raiden:
        Colonel, you were monitoring the Codec calls. That man was the real
        Snake, all along...
Colonel:
        Maybe.
Raiden:
        Maybe?
Colonel:
        Don’t let your guard down with him.
Raiden:
        Why do you say that?
Colonel:
        Because they were never part of the simulation. They an unknown
        factor.
Raiden:
        You can take your simulation and --! We’re out here and we bleed!
Rose:
        Calm down.
Colonel:
        I suggest that you do Raiden.
Colonel:
        Even if this is Snake, that had no bearing on the mission.
Raiden:
        Colonel, you and Snake used to be on the same side.
Colonel:
        ...
Raiden:
        I don’t understand. I read about you and Snake in ‘In the Darkness of
        Shadow Moses’.
Colonel:
        I don’t give a damn what that piece of trash said. Do you get me?

Pre-electrified floor scene, Shell 2 core

Raiden has shot down the Harrier and successfully infiltrated the core of
Shell 2, where the President is being held. When he enters the corridor of
the core, he hears a woman’s whisper (radio communication) from the south
corner. The other voice, coming out of the radio, is apparently Solidus’.

Solidus:
        (OFF) Olga - Snake - he’s here. In Shell 1.

Raiden cautiously approaches the turn (corner) in the corridor.

Olga:
        (OFF) My father had some unfinished business with him!

Raiden flattens himself against the corner and tries to get a look at the
speaker. Olga stands in front of the door (to the room where the President is
being held), facing the other way. She is holding the radio to her ear.

Solidus:
        (OFF) Olga, calm yourself!

Raiden automatically readies the directional mic. The left, right, up and
down keys work, but Raiden cannot move to another spot. Listen in on Olga’s
call in the same manner as before. Unless the mic is pointed in the right
direction, the lines will be lost. The player cannot see Olga, and the radio
cannot be used during the demo.

Solidus:
        (OFF) We will not change the plan because of your personnel feelings.
Olga:
        Then screw your plan! I’ve been waiting for this day for two years,
        and I WILL send him to the bottom of the ocean, right next to my
        old man!
Solidus:
        (OFF) The launch (of Arsenal Gear) comes first.
Olga:
        Damnit!

Sound of a fist crashing into the wall.

Olga:
        Where’s Ocelot?
Solidus:
        (OFF) Not here.
Olga:
        I don’t trust him.
Solidus:
        (OFF) Don’t talk that way about one of your own.
Olga:
        He’s NOT one of my own. He left my father to die, remember?
Solidus:	
        (OFF) Olga, we’ll talk later. We need to get started on the final
        checks for the unit (Arsenal).
Olga:
        All right. I’m headed back there.
Solidus:
        (OFF) The upper connecting bridge to Shell 1 is down.
Olga:
        What about the chopper?
Solidus:
        (OFF) The Kamov is out of action. Take the oil fence from Strut L.

Filler during the Emma Sniping Event.

        at large.
Olga:
        Snake...
Solidus:
        (OFF) What about the other man?
Olga:
        He’s got luck on his side, certainly.
Solidus:
        (OFF) Hm, he survived that explosion... Listen Olga, the Code
        confirmation is in one hour. Keep the President alive until then.
Olga:
        I know - no one gets in here. Turn the currents on.
Solidus:

The President stands neat the circuit panel. He is not bound or cuffed.

Olga:
        And its no job for bare hands.
Solidus:
        (OFF) All right. Come back immediately.
Olga:
        One more thing...

Olga is staring at the charged floor. Raiden listens intently through the wall.

Solidus:
        (OFF) What?

Olga starts to walk down the hall. At her approach, Raiden looks for a hiding
spot.

Olga:
        We leave for Russia when this business is done. I want half the money
        for that.
Solidus:
        (OFF) Of course. That was part of the agreement.

Colonel:
        Try the ventilation ducts.
Raiden:
        Yeah, I think I see one.
Colonel:
        Look for a remote-control missile launcher. You can guide it through
        the duct into the room.

Raiden:

        can raise him.
Colonel:
        We’ve tried that repeatedly, but there’s no response. It looks like
        the walls have a built in radio shield.
Raiden:
        So that’s why Ames lost contact with him...
Colonel:

      To The President 12



P048_01_P01 Destruction of the power source panel 1 polygon demo 1 (MC)
Air purification maintenance room

To rescue the President, Raiden heads for the core of Shell 2. The President
is imprisoned in a room that is surrounded by a floor wired to release high-
voltage electricity. Using a remote-controlled missile, Raiden must destroy a
circuit breaker to cut the electricity and gain access to the President’s
room.

To the game



P049_01_P01 The President 1 polygon demo 1(MC)

After destroying the circuit breaker with the remote-controlled missile,
Raiden manages to steal his way into the Air Purification Maintenance Room of
Shell 2’s Central Building where the President is being held.

Air Purification Maintenance Room

Raiden enters the room. Although he’s had a chance to check out the room with
the remote-controlled missile, he proceeds cautiously with SOCOM drawn. After
walking through the first small room, the President approaches him. Smoke is
still drifting from the destroyed circuit breaker beyond him. Raiden
recognizes the President - he’s seen him on television - and puts his gun
away. He faces the 44th President of the United States of America, James
Johnson.

Raiden:
        President Johnson...

Recognizing Raiden’s equipment, the President abandons all hope.

President:
        So you’re finally here... (He believes that an underling has been
        sent by the Patriots to kill him for his betrayal)
Raiden:
        You’ve been expecting me?
President:
        Your equipment - that Skull Suit isn’t exactly standard military
        issue.
Raiden:
        ...Are you all right, sir?

Raiden checks the President for injuries, but doesn’t find anything wrong.
The President questions Raiden’s concern.

President:
        Is this some kind of sick joke?
Raiden:
        ?
President:
        I thought you came here to kill me...
Raiden:
        ?

The President approaches Raiden.

President:
        I’m prepared to face the consequences of my betrayal.
Raiden:
        What are you!?
President:
        ...(Thinking)

The President pulls Raiden up close. Raiden is surprised by the President’s
sudden intimacy. The President reaches between Raiden’s legs.

Raiden:
        What the --!
President:
        You’re... a man...? (it’s not that woman)

The President pulls his hand back. He realizes that Raiden is not a
member/ninja of the Patriots.

President:
        Hmph. Well, who are you?
Raiden:
        FOXHOUND, sir. (Raiden unquestioningly replies to the President)
President:
        FOXHOUND? (thinks for a moment)

Nodding to himself, the President turns and walks away from Raiden.

President:
        I see. Now things are starting to make a little sense... (sneers at
        himself with despair and abandon)

The President stops to consider the situation and realizes that this is part
of the S3 Plan. He had thought he’d betrayed the Patriots on his own
volition. But it turns out that he was being manipulated. Losing all hope, he
turns and faces Raiden.

President:
        Switch over to nanocommunication so nobody can listen in.
Raiden:
        Yes, sir.

Raiden:
        Mr. President, it’s my understanding that the terrorists have managed
        to input the code sequence necessary for launching a nuclear strike.
President:
        That’s correct. (readily acknowledges the fact) I punched the
        sequence in myself.
Raiden:
        You’re working for them?
President:
        If you asked me two hours ago; my answer would have been yes. Right
        now, they’re keeping me alive until my vital signs are confirmed.
Raiden:
        They betrayed you?
President:
        I wouldn’t quite put it that way. We had a conflict of ideals... and
        I lost. I wanted power. They sought destruction
Raiden:
        Ideals? What kind of ideals can justify terrorism!? (denies ideals)

        No. I’m just a figurehead.

        This country is shaped and controlled as the Patriots see fit. The

        Whether you believe it or not, the balance of power rests in the
        hands of the Patriots.
President:
        They regulate the country’s carious interests through controlled
        presentation, staging a ‘drama’ that is palatable to the general
        masses. Can you imagine what would happen if they ceased to function?
Raiden:
        ?
President:
        Picture a massive political vacuum, a space that every power-monger
        will try to fill for their own greedy ends. I’m talking about an
        unregulated power struggle  panic, civil war, ...chaos.
President:
        Like it or not - the Patriots is an organization that must continue
        to exist.
Raiden:
        (Ironic... coming from a President involved in global terrorism) So
        you changed your mind because you wanted to avoid global chaos?
President:
        Exactly. When I told Solidus I wished to prevent disaster, he replied
        that pawns can never become players (expressed with self-regret and a
        little envy)
Raiden:
        And who is this... Solidus?

A depiction of Solidus during his Presidential term.

President:
        My predecessor... The 43rd President, George Sears. That was the name
        the public came to know him by. I knew him by his codename,
        ‘Solidus Snake’.
President:
        He was the third Snake, preceded by Solid and Liquid... a survivor
        of the ‘Les Enfants Terribles’ project. Neither Solid nor Liquid, he
        was a well-balanced masterpiece that the Patriots saw fit to entrust
        with the Presidency.
President:
        However, he fell out of grace with the organization four years ago
        when, acting on his own, he started an incident.
Raiden:
        Four years ago... Shadow Moses?

President:
        That’s right. At the time, the DARPA chief, Donald Anderson 
        together with certain influential parties  initiated the development
        of Metal Gear REX and an advanced nuclear warhead. However, this did
        not fall in line wit the Patriots plans. What’s more, Solidus decided
        on his own to send his most trusted man, Ocelot, to provoke Liquid
        Snake, bringing about the said incident.

President:
        As a result, he succeeded in obtaining REX and data on the warhead.
        But in doing so, he ended up revealing the existence of both REX and
        the Genome army  a blunder that earned him the wrath of
        the Patriots.
President:
        Shortly thereafter, Solidus was removed from the Presidential Office.

Raiden:
        I thought he resigned... general.
President:
        That’s the story given to the public. Following his ‘resignation’,
        the Patriots selected me - their new pawn, for the Presidency.
Raiden:
        But that would mean that the Presidential race was --
President:
        That was quite a show, wasn’t it? It was a well-scripted drama staged
        by the Patriots for the benefit of the public. Even the Democrats and
        Republicans were dancing to the Patriots’ tune.
President:
        ...Everything went according to plan, but for one exception...
Raiden:
        ?
President:
        Following his resignation, Solidus’ health was scheduled to fail him,
        bringing about his untimely death.
Raiden:
        Capped...? (Drags any semblance of respect)
President:
        Correct. But before the Patriots could execute their plots, Solidus
        went underground with the help of Ocelot. As he avoided pursuit,
        Solidus gained control of Dead Cell, winning over Colonel
        Gurlukovich’s outfit. From there, he bided his time, knowing that his
        opportunity would soon arrive...
Raiden:
        What opportunity?
President:
        The completion of the new Metal Gear project  an opportunity that
        would even his odds against the Patriots.
President:
        By stealing the Patriots’ most valued project, he would be able to
        place them in a very uncomfortable position. It’s the only chance he
        has for survival.
President:
        Once he has the new Metal Gear, he’ll declare war against the
        Patriots. Needles to say, he must be stopped.
Raiden:
        (Talking to himself) Metal Gear is already operational...
President:
        No. Not yet.
Raiden:
        ?
President:
        What you saw was Metal Gear RAY - hijacked two years ago from the
        Marines by Ocelot. That was not the new Metal Gear.
Raiden:
        Then, where’s the new Metal Gear?
President:
        Right here.
Raiden:
        What?
President:
        You’re standing in it. To be more precise, this entire Big Shell
        facility is the new Metal Gear.
Raiden:
        What’d you say? (no sign of respect)
President:
        No, I’m quite serious. The upper structure that you’ve seen is
        camouflage - designed to represent an offshore cleanup facility. The
        main structure extends from the foundation all the way down to the
        ocean floor. The connecting elevator is located on the B2 floor of
        the Shell 1 Core.
President:
        Arsenal Gear... that’s the codename for the new Metal Gear.
Raiden:
        Arsenal--?

President:
        That’s right... Arsenal. We’re talking about an impregnable fortress
        carrying a load of over a couple of thousand missiles including
        nuclear warheads - all protected by a horde of mass-produced
        Metal Gear RAY units.
Raiden:
        Mass-produced...?
President:
        The RAY unit was originally designed for the Marines to be used as a
        countermeasure against the Metal Gear variations throughout the
        world. The Patriots had RAY redesigned to protect the new
        Arsenal Gear.
Raiden:
        So now the anti-Metal Gear are guarding a Metal Gear?
President:
        Ironic, isn’t it? (Actually Raiden was also redesigned by the
        Patriots)
President:
        That’s not all. Arsenal Gear has full access to the Military’s
        Tactical Network, giving it the ability to exercise absolute control
        over our nation’s armed forces, not to mention our nuclear armament.
        In short, Arsenal was created to be the core of our country.
Raiden:
        What kind of idiotic weapon --?
President:
        Weapon? No. You’re not seeing the full picture.
Raiden:
        ?
President:
        Arsenal Gear is more than just a military tool.

President:
        It is a means to preserve the world as it is. It will establish a new
        form of control. The Patriots will use it to keep their place as the
        country’s true rulers... Right now they feel pressured and
        threatened.
Raiden:
        By what?
President:
        They fear an overabundance of digital information - the flow of
        information, making it possible to shape the ‘truth’ for their own
        purposes. In short, the Arsenal’s system is the key to their
        supremacy.
Raiden:
        The key--?
President:
        Yes, the ‘GW’ system  is the Patriots trump card. Arsenal Gear will
        be fully operational when ‘GW’ is successfully integrated. Once
        operational, it will be a completely new form of power for the
        Patriots to wield.
President:
        I had hoped to seize the project from them so that I would be in a
        strong bargaining position...
Raiden:
        Bargain for what?
President:
        I’d hoped to trade my way into their ranks. But Solidus preferred
        rebellion. Outer Heaven - his plan to unleash a nuclear blast over
        the business community - is also a key factor in his offensive
        effort.
Raiden:
        Outer Heaven...?
President:
        Listen. There isn’t much time. The ‘football’ served as the key for
        activating Arsenal Gear. I’ve already input the necessary code
        sequence...
President:
        It won’t be long before ‘GW’ begins to establish connections with
        other external systems and Arsenal Gear becomes fully operational.
        Stop them before that happens. That is your role.
Raiden:
        Role?
President:
        You’ve got to find Emma Emmerich. She’s the only one who can stop
        that thing once it’s been activated.
Raiden:
        Emma... Emmerich? (There’s something about the name)
President:
        She’s the system programmer for Arsenal Gear. I believe she’s
        somewhere on level B1 in the core of this building.
Raiden:
        I thought the levels below us were flooded?
President:
        I’m sure they won’t let her die just yet as she’s the only remaining
        programmer for this project. According to Ocelot, she was being held
        in a locker room located in the northwest part of level B1.

        Cut transmission, and get moving!

President:

President hands Raiden an MO disc(shades of the Armstech President).

Raiden:
        What is it?
President:
        A program for disrupting the control functions between ‘GW’ and
        Arsenal Gear. Take Emma to the computer room on level B2, Shell 1
        Core. She’ll know how to load the program into the main system.
Raiden:
        A virus?
President:
        That’s right. Modeled after FOXDIE, a biological weapon designed to
        selectively eliminate personnel, with a specific genetic code.
Raiden:
        But why do you have it?
President:
        The Patriots had it engineered as a failsafe... And Ocelot forgot to
        search me. (He wasn’t searched to make sure that the disc was handed
        to Raiden. It’s a similar situation to the Armstech President in the
        previous game.
President:
        You’ve got to hurry! That disc is the only way you’re going to stop
        Arsenal.

President stands back and looks at Raiden.

President:
        Well, I’ve told you everything you need to know. There’s only one
        thing left that remains to be done...
Raiden:
        !?

The President seizes Raiden’s gun (SOCOM) and points the barrel at his won
chest.

President:
        Now, kill me!
Raiden:
        What the --!?
President:
        There’s no time to argue! The final check for my vital ID will start
        any second! If you kill me now, you’ll at least prevent the nuclear
        strike!

The President pulls the barrel closer, and presses down on Raiden’s trigger
finger.

Raiden:
        Cut that out! (absolutely no respect)
President:
        Do it! That’s your role!

The two men struggle.

President:
        Pull!

Gunshots ring out.

The Presidents chest is riddled with bullets.

President:
        (Scream)
Ocelot:
        That’s abusing your right to free speech Mr. President. Or is it...
        Ex-President?

Raiden whips around, pointing the gun towards the direction of the voice. A
revolver can be seen extending from behind a pillar. Smoke drifts from the
barrel.

Raiden:
       The President! Why did you --!?
Ocelot:
        Alas, my finger must have slipped...

The revolver spins in the air, dumping the empty cartridges.

Ocelot:
        I’ll see you around, ‘Carrier boy’...

The Carrier boy reference is the same as in the previous game. It refers to
the situation with the MO disc. The Patriots wish to wipe the data referring
to themselves which is contained in the A.I.. Like with Snake in the Shadow
Moses Incident, they are out to manipulate Raiden.
Ocelot runs off. Raiden attempts to pursue the assassin, but the President
seizes Raiden’s leg, and pulls him closer.

President:
        Forget him... he... did us a favor...

Raiden bends down to listen to the President.

President:
        Without free will, there is no difference between submission and
        rebellion. My only real choice is to put an end to this charade...
        let me at least have the freedom... to end it myself... (Realizing
        his terrorist plot was being used to the advantage of the Patriots S3
        Plan, the President has lost all hope. He completes his pre-planned
        role in the S3 Plan by acting out his own demise before Raiden. This
        development acts as a metaphor to foreshadow developments in the
        player’s relationship in the game.)
Raiden:
        What are you - (trying to say)?
President:
        Find Emma... stop Arsenal. This is my last order - as your
        Commander-and-Chief... I’m counting on you...!

Colonel:

Raiden:
        Where do we go from here?
Colonel:
        Your mission was to rescue the President and eliminate the terrorist
        threat. However, given the recent turn of events, we will honor the
        President’s last directive. You must put a stop to Arsenal Gear once
        and for all.
Raiden:
        Do you actually think there’s any truth to his story about this Big
        Shell facility being a front for Arsenal Gear?
Colonel:
        I don’t have the security clearance necessary to verify the facts.
        However, he was the President. I’m sure that he knew what he was
        talking about.
Raiden:
        Aren’t you forgetting that he was part of the terrorist plot?
Colonel:
        All the more reason why I believe his information is reliable.
Raiden:
        ...
Colonel:
        We’re talking about a man who chose to die rather than risk a nuclear
        holocaust.
Colonel:
        Thanks to his sacrifice, the nuclear launch authority has shifted to
        the Vice President, effectively eliminating the terrorist threat.
Raiden:
        Colonel, when you put it like that, it almost sounds like I should’ve
        assassinated the President to ‘eliminate the threat’.
Colonel:
        That was not my intention. I was trying to point out that there is
        certainly some credibility to the words of a man who chose death to
        protect the innocent.
Rose:
        The Colonel has a point, Jack.
Raiden:

Colonel:
        Raiden, we’re running out of time. Find Emma. She’s supposed to be
        located on level B1, in the core of that building you’re in, right?
Raiden:

Colonel:
        You’ve got to find her before Arsenal become operational.
Rose:
        Hurry Jack!

receives a call from Snake via Codec.

Snake:
        What’s your status, Raiden?
Raiden:
        Snake? The President... he’s been assassinated.
Snake:
        What!?
Raiden:
        There was nothing I could do --
Snake:
       What about the nuclear strike code sequence!?
Raiden:
        He died before his vital ID could be reconfirmed.
Snake:
        Then the enemy’s lost their nuclear strike capability --
Raiden:
        But, that Ocelot guy obviously killed the President on purpose.
Snake:
        Why?
Raiden:
        It doesn’t make any sense. They had to know that they couldn’t launch
        the nuke if they killed the President.
Otacon:
        Maybe there’s a way to launch without reconfirming the vital ID?
Snake:
        Or maybe they’ve found a more effective weapon within Arsenal Gear.
Raiden:
        You knew about Arsenal Gear!?
Snake:
        Yeah...
Raiden:
        Then why didn’t you tell me about it? (obviously displeased)
Snake:
        You never asked.
Raiden:
        (Irritated) Am I correct in assuming you also know that the Big
        Shell’s a front for the project?
Snake:
        You mean, did I know that the Big Shell, a fully functioning
        environmental cleanup facility, was designed to camouflage Arsenal
        Gear? -Yeah I did. It’s exactly what the President and Ames
        described... a massive cover story. The good news is that it hasn’t
        really done much in terms of cleaning up the environment so we won’t
        have to worry about any toxic gas being released if we have to blow
        the house down.
Raiden:
        Right... and when did you find all this out?
Snake:
        It took a while, but we uncovered the info around the time you took
        out that mad bomber.
Raiden:
        ...
Snake:
        There’s not doubt that Arsenal Gear is being built here... then it
        was all set up two years ago on that day - all of it.

Snake:
        I’d infiltrated the dummy tanker to obtain proof that a Metal Gear
        was under development. Shortly after I made it aboard, an armed group
        led by Colonel Gurlukovich raided the ship and gained control.
Otacon:
        Olga and Ocelot were among the raiding party.
Snake:
        Yeah. And him...
Raiden:
        Who’re you talking about?
Snake:
        A man that was supposed to be dead.
Otacon:
        Their target was also Metal Gear RAY. But Ocelot eliminated Colonel
        Gurlukovich and Marine Commandant Scott Dolph - and he hijacked RAY.
Raiden:
        So he betrayed them?
Snake:
        I don’t know what kind of deal was going down. All I remember is what
        Ocelot said at the time - something like ‘I’m taking it back’...
Otacon:
        Ocelot then sank the tanker along wit the soldiers of the Marine
        Corps...

        Since the Shadow Moses incident, Snake became sort of a hero. I think
        the Patriots weren’t to happy about that.
Raiden:
        You know about the Patriots!?
Otacon:
        Well, yes... to a certain degree.
Raiden:
        It seems like everyone knows about them except me. (Irritated)
        (Raiden: Okay, great. (irritated))
Otacon:
        They didn’t choose Snake to be a hero...
Raiden:
        So they decided to do a smear campaign?
Otacon:
        I think the Patriots wanted to make an example of him so everybody
        would think twice before opposing them.
Raiden:
        That’s it? They set up all this just to nail you guys?

Speech Scene (game screen visuals) displayed

Otacon:
        No. There’s more to it than that  the Marine’s Metal Gear RAY
        project headed by Commander Dolph was carried out in opposition to
        the Navy’s Arsenal Gear project.
Otacon:
        To be more precise, the Patriots considered Metal Gear RAY to be a
        thorn in their side. Hence, they attacked the dummy tanker wand stole
        RAY...
Otacon:
        They followed this up with the perfect plan. They immediately sent a
        fully loaded tanker to the same location and sank it, then set up the
        facility to camouflage the development of Arsenal Gear.
Snake:
        And we fell for it - two more puppets in their show.

Scenes of a fallen Olga, and the shooting of the Colonel are displayed.

Raiden:
        Colonel Gurlukovich ...and his daughter, Olga?
Otacon:
        Both fell victim to Ocelot’s plot.

Scene of Ocelot killing a soldier is displayed.

Raiden:
        Was Solidus behind all this? He used Ocelot to get ahold of RAY, huh?
Otacon:
        No, he was underground, keeping a low profile at the time.
Raiden:
        Then it must be the Patriots...
Otacon:
        If that’s the case, what’s Ocelot doing alongside Solidus?
Raiden:
        ...(No idea)

Snake:
        Forget it. We’re wasting time. We can figure this out later. The
        nuclear strike’s been prevented, but Arsenal still has a massive
        payload of missiles to deal with.
Otacon:
        Right. If the opposition gets control of those missiles... (we’ll
        have a major situation on our hands)
Snake:
        Raiden -- you’ve got to find Emma.
Raiden:
        Wait a second. Isn’t Emma Emmerich...
Otacon:
        ...My sister.
Raiden:
        What’s she doing here?
Otacon:
        You got me. She’s a computer whiz who specializes in neural AI and
        ultra-variable volume data analysis using complex logic. How she got
        involved in weapons development is beyond me.
Raiden:
        ...(In deep thought)
Snake:
        Whatever her reasons, we need her in order to stop Arsenal.
Otacon:
        Raiden - find her.
Raiden:
        I’m on my way.

P051_01_R01 Emma & Otacon 1 Codec demo 1 (Colonel standard)
Codec screen

While en route to rescue Emma, Raiden speaks with the Colonel via Codec, and
learns about Emma’s background.


Raiden:
        Colonel, I want some background information on Emma Emmerich.
Colonel:
        I’ve got it right here, direct from the National Security Agency’s
        personnel files. Apparently she was involved in some sort of high-
        level project, but there are no details on that. Her record shows
        that she resign from the Agency two years ago  (She was moved to the
        Arsenal development project)
Colonel:
        Emma Emmerich. Full name: Emma Emmerich-Danziger. Members of her
        family call her EE. After divorcing Hal Emmerich’s father, he
        mother took Emma to England and raised her there. Danziger is her
        mother’s maiden name, but she prefers Emmerich.
Colonel:
        After returning home to England, her mother married Robinson, a
        businessman. The following details are from a report filed with the
        NSA when she joined the agency...
Colonel:
        Just before graduating from high school, Emma injured Robinson in
        self-defense during an alleged (sexual) assault on her person. As a
        result of this incident, she followed in the footsteps of her
        stepbrother, Hal Emmerich, and left home to enroll in Oxford. It is
        believed at this particular point in her life, she was extremely
        angered by the fact that her brother failed to protect her.
        Consequently, she lost all family connections and is very resentful.
        She seems to believe that her brother is to blame for everything.
Colonel:
        While attending Oxford, she was noted for her success in a
        deciphering even sponsored by the British GCHQ.
Raiden:
        They may not be blood-related, but she sure sounds like Otacon’s
        sister.
Colonel:
        There’s more--
Colonel:
        Raiden, do you recall a certain ‘situation’ that’s more or less
        become a legend among hackers?
Colonel:
        To refresh your memory—at the time, just about all of our nation’s
        communication and information resources were concentrated at the NSA,
        in Forte Meade.
Colonel:
        In fact, the NSA’s basement facility operated round the clock to
        amass data obtained not only from public communication, but
        everything from satellite to wire tap operations as well.
Colonel:
        I don’t think I’m exaggerating when I say that whoever controlled the
        NSA facility could move the world.
Colonel:
        On January 24th the year 2000, the facility suffered a total shutdown
        for a 73-hour period.
Raiden:
        Did they ever figure out the cause?
Colonel:
        It’s believed that a small group within the government (the Patriots)
        had arranged the incident with the assistance of a notorious group of
        hackers. The result was a full review of the NSA’s safety measures,
        which in turn led to the decision to shift the data-gathering
        operations to an isolated location that would be safe from physical
        attack as well as cyber-terrorism. (This is a reference to
        Arsenal Gear)
Raiden:
        And where might that be?
Colonel:
        My security clearance couldn’t get me that information. But I did
        find out that one of the key members of the hacker group was none
        other than Emma Emmerich.
Colonel:
        Although she started off as a specialist in Artificial Intelligence
        and complex logic, Emma is now regarded as a computer genius.
Raiden:
        That would make her a prime candidate for recruitment in the
        intelligence community, wouldn’t it? And knowing most of the
        intelligence agencies, I doubt fair play was a major concern in their
        recruiting efforts...
Colonel:
        Your assumption’s correct. The government (the Patriots) played on
        her weakness  her strong hate for Hal Emmerich, the brother who left
        her when she was six years old.
Raiden:
        She hates him that much?
Colonel:
        When she was six years old, Emma and her father were involved in a
        pool accident. She survived, but her father drowned.
Raiden:
        What did the police have to say about that?
Colonel:
        Their report states it was an accidental death.
Raiden:
        Isn’t that about the time Otacon left his home and family?
Colonel:
        Exactly. But I don’t have any idea why he chose to do so.
Raiden:
        Does Emma blame Otacon for her father’s death?
Colonel:
        I don’t think so. Her hate seems to stem from the fact that she
        believes Otacon abandoned her. You see, although the two weren’t
        directly related, they were said to be very close.

Colonel:
        It’s rumored that sibling rivalry was what launched her career as a
        hacker. Four years ago, the government leaked her details of the
        Shadow Moses incident. In doing so, they were able to recruit her for
        the NSA.
Colonel:
        I also have little doubt that they also used the NSA hacking affair
        as a means to convince her to cooperate.
Raiden:
        You think that her hate drove her to frame Snake and Otacon?
Colonel:
        That - I don’t know.

Rose contacts Raiden via Codec.

Rose:

Raiden:
        What is it?
Rose:
        ...I’ve always been alone...
Raiden:
        Huh?
Rose:
        I’m so lonely...
Raiden:
        Rose, we’ve always --
Rose:
        Not always.
Raiden:
        What do you mean?
Rose:
        You’ve never slept beside me...
Raiden:
        What are you talking about? I--
Rose:
        After we’ve been together in my room... you stay awake all night or
        head for the door.
Raiden:
        Is this really the time to bring this up?
Rose:
        Why, Jack? why?
Raiden:
        Listen Rose, I’m right in the middle of a mission, and I...
Rose:
        Why!? Why can’t you relax when you’re with me!?
Raiden:
        Look... the mission... I...
Rose:
        Why don’t you open up to me?
Raiden:
        Rose... I... I just can’t! (Raiden is led into the conversation)
Rose:
        All I ever wanted was to share your dreams - to spend a meaningful
        evening with you...
Rose:
        I just wanted to find you by my side when I woke up. Is that asking
        for too much?
Raiden:
        It’s the night - I’m scared of the night... it’s got nothing to do
        with you...
Rose:
        Scared of the night? What’s that supposed to mean!
Raiden:
        I can’t relax when I’m with someone...
Rose:
        Jack? You wouldn’t even let me in your room! (She was trying to spy
        on him.)
Raiden:
        I need privacy... I just can’t be bothered.
Rose:
        Bothered!?
Raiden:
        Wrong word! What I wanted to say was that there are certain things
        that I have to keep to myself... (He doesn’t want his past to be
        known)
Rose:
        Do you remember that tie I forced my way into your room? We’d known
        each other for almost a year... and you blew up! It was the first
        time you ever raised your hand against me! (starts sobbing)
Raiden:
        ...(regret)
Rose:
        I was so worried about you... (that I barged into your room)
Raiden:
        Look... I’m sorry...
Rose:
        It wasn’t your violent nature that scared me. It was your room...
        your heart...
Raiden:
        Stop it...
Rose:
        There wasn’t anything in your room - only a bed and a small desk. It
        looked like a prison cell... (she cries a little)
Raiden:
        Rose? (why are you crying?)
Rose:
        No television set... no family pictures... not even a poster...
Raiden:
        Rose, I only use that room for sleeping.
Rose:
        A lifeless room... almost like your empty heart.
Raiden:
        That’s why I tried to keep you out.
Rose:
        I thought I was beginning to understand you - until I saw that room.
Raiden:
        Would you’ve been happier if I had a picture of you hanging on the
        wall? (sarcastically)
Rose:
        That’s not what I was trying to say--
Raiden:
        Enough, Rose. We’ll talk about this later... after the mission.
Rose:
        Right... after the mission... I understand.

P053_01_R01 Catch your breath 1 Codec demo 1 (Otacon mandatory Call)
Codec demo

Heading for Emma, Raiden rushes through the flooded interior of Shell 2’s
core. There are certain spots in the building that are totally flooded,
requiring him to swim. Along the way, when Raiden stops to catch his breath,
he receives a call from Otacon on his Codec.

Otacon:
        Raiden, are you reading me? This is Otacon. What’s your situation?
Raiden:
        Wet and miserable... The place is flooded. The seawater that’s been
        pumped up is pouring into the building.
Otacon:
        I see. Listen, there’s something I have to tell you about EE.
Raiden:
        Don’t worry about her. I’ll get her out--
Otacon:
        She’s afraid of water.
Raiden:
        What!?
Otacon:
        Yeah... when she was six years old, she almost drowned with my father
        in our swimming pool.
Raiden:
        She can’t swim!?
Otacon:
        Well yes and no... we used to swim a lot together when we were kids.
        In fact, she swam like a fish until that day when she almost
        drowned...

If the Colonel’s explanation has been heard by the user.

Raiden:
       (Whisper) That pretty much coincides with what the Colonel told me...
Otacon:
        When the accident happened, I was in my room. I heard later that EE
        was calling me for help...
Otacon:
        She didn’t doubt for a minute that I’d be there.
Otacon:
        You could see the pool from my room... but I didn’t realize at the
        time that she needed my help.
Raiden:
        What were you doing?
Otacon:
        I... I was...

Actually Emma saw what was going on before she almost drowned.

Raiden:
        So Emma survived the ordeal...
Otacon:
        Yeah, but my father didn’t...
Raiden:
        So you blamed yourself and left your family?
Otacon:
        No. EE seems to believe that was the case. The fact is... I betrayed
        her.
Raiden:
        And you think she can’t swim because of the traumatic experience?
Otacon:
        I haven’t seen her since that day... but yes, I think so.
Otacon:
        I got a letter from Julie, her mother - after they moved back to
        England. In her letter, she mentioned that EE couldn’t swim
        anymore... that she refused to even wear a bathing suit.
Raiden:
        Damn! If she still can’t swim we’re in trouble... level B1 of the
        core is pretty much flooded.
Otacon:
        Look... maybe you can help her get over it?
Raiden:
        You want me to help her get over it?
Otacon:
        It’s still going to take some time to repair the Kamov...
Snake:
        Sorry, kid. Emma’ rescue is up to you.
Raiden:
        (Sharp nasal snort) Thanks. An underwater mission... well, this is a
        first (VR training mission unavailable) Look - I’ll see what I can
        do. (Considering his situation, Raiden’s not very confident)
Snake:
        I suggest you drum the map of the building into your head. Cause you
        won’t have the time to look at it when you try to bring Emma out.
Otacon:
        I’m counting on you, Raiden.
Snake:
        I covered most of the core when I had to take out the C4’s... if
        there’s anything you need to ask me, call me on the Codec.
Raiden:
        I’ll do that.

P054_01_P01 Peter’s corpse 1 polygon demo 1 (KF)
Underwater in the core of Shell 2

Raiden swims through the flooded core of Shell 2, heading for Emma’s
location. Along the way, he opens a sealed hatch in a flooded compartment.

When Raiden pulls the hatch open, a body mutilated by an explosion suddenly
appears before him, it’s arms open as if trying to embrace him. Shocked by
the sudden appearance, Raiden loses some of his precious air. Crimson(blood)
surges out from the Filter Chamber, the room where the body was located.
Regaining his composure, Raiden pulls back and calmly watches the dead body.
He studies the relatively undamaged face of the lifeless body and realizes
that he’s looking at Peter, the bomb disposal instructor.

After saying his farewell to Peter, Raiden closes the hatch.

     To  Pre-Vamp battle 4



P055_01_P01 Pre-Vamp battle 1 polygon demo 1 (MC)
Filter Chamber

Making his way past the flooded area, Raiden reaches the block where Emma is
believed to be held captive. He is in the Filter Chamber, which has a pool in
the center of the room. The ceiling of the chamber throws back the diffusion
reflection of the water’s surface. Beams of light radiate from the pools and
dance on the ceiling, the overall scene has a surreal quality to it. The
scene will use the effects from the pool infiltration scene. To emphasize
Vamp’s shadow-binding, full use will be made of the shadow stretching effect.
Vamp is floating on the water’s surface. It almost appears like he is
suspended slightly above the water. The hair on his chest is highly
noticeable. He sits cross-legged like a ballet dancer as he floats over the
water. The lights from below the water play across his face, making him look
like a character from Count Dracula. Vamp’s eyes are closed. His forehead
is marked with an open gunshot wound, which was inflicted by Raiden.

Raiden:
        Still ticking, huh?

Vamp’s eyes open.

Vamp:
        Unfortunately, hell had no vacancies...

Using a special breathing exercise, Vamp focuses his concentration. He slowly
stands as if he’s easing the tension in his body. The whole routine looks
like the stretch exercises of a ballet performer or a dancer.

Raiden:
        HA! (attack scream)

Raiden abruptly opens fire. As if executing a series of ballet moves, Vamp
elegantly dodges the bullets.

Raiden:
        Argh... !

Like a ballet dancer waiting for applause, Vamp bends forward in a low bow. A
line of blood trickles down his cheek. Vamp stands tall and glares at Raiden.
He is wounded in the side. (He was wounded when he was shot by Raiden during
their encounter on Strut B.)

Vamp:
        Ha ha ha ha... I thought so... (He sounds almost happy)

Vamp can read a bullet’s course by watching his enemy’s muscle to judge their
aim. He is 100% accurate when judging the shots fired by an ordinary
opponent. However, the pressure applied by Raiden’s Skull Suit restricts
muscle movement, making his moves difficult to read. This is explained via
radio.

With his well-developed canines peaking out from both sides of his mouth,
Vamp smiles.

Vamp:
        Human muscles are eloquent. They speak out quite clearly what a
        person’s next move will be. They even tell me which way a gun is
        going to be pointing before the trigger is pulled. But your muscles
        -- they’re different...
Vamp:
        This should be fun... well worth the wait. (Informed by Ocelot that
        Raiden was coming this way to rescue Emma, Vamp had been waiting for
        Raiden’s arrival)

Stretching out his long tongue, Vamp delightfully licks the blood around his
lips. It is fairly obvious that Raiden is shaken. Like a bat spreading its
wings, Vamp spreads both his arms out wide.

Raiden:
        You knew I was coming...
Vamp:
        You’ve become a nuisance. I can’t let you interfere with Arsenal
        Gear.
Vamp:
        The girl is just ahead. She’s of no use to us now... but she served
        us well as the live bait for the big catch. Crazy Ivan sometimes
        speaks the truth. (Crazy Ivan = Russian = Ocelot.

The locker room where Emma is held captive appears on-screen. The room is
pretty much flooded. Emma has taken refuge inside a locker and cannot be seen
at this time. The camera slowly pans the scene.

Raiden:
        Emma’s alive...
Vamp:
        She was, some time ago. But the flooding has become quite serious -
        I wouldn’t be surprised if she’s a mermaid now.
Raiden:
        ...!
Vamp:
        Did you really think killing the President would prevent a nuclear
        strike? Think again?
Raiden:
        I didn’t do it!
Vamp:
        Hm. Arsenal is still armed with a purified Hydrogen bomb?

        Purified Hydrogen bomb?

P055_03_M01 Pre-Vamp battle 3 movie demo 7 (clean thermonuclear bomb)
Movie

Purified hydrogen bomb blueprints, etc...

Vamp:
        This is no ordinary bomb. This weapon is capable of heavy Hydrogen
        nuclear fusion using lasers and magnetics to generate heat-insulated
        compression.
Vamp:
        It was a top secret project initiated by the current President... and
        Solidus has no idea of its existence.
Vamp:
        The clean thermonuclear bomb is at an experimental stage and is a
        differently handled nuclear weapon. Specifically, it becomes launch-
        capable with Arsenal is activated. In short, a nuclear threat still
        exists.
Raiden:
        Then Wall Street could still...
Vamp:
        That was Solidus’ intent, not ours.
Raiden:
        Then what re you... ?
Vamp:
        We’re not going to let Solidus have the bomb  he’s a fool to believe
        that an electromagnetic pulse over Wall Street is going to faze the
        Patriots...
Vamp:
        To destroy them, the city that they control must be reduced to
        rubble. Only that would bring them out in the open where they can be
        destroyed.
Raiden:
        Nuke the city?
Vamp:
        Six months ago, we lost everything we believed in...
Vamp:
        We were abandoned to take the fall in their cover up. We were labeled
        as killers responsible for the mass-murder of  civilians as well as
        our own allies.
Vamp:
        And the ‘public’ believed every word, turning a deaf ear to whatever
        we had to say to the contrary.
Vamp:
        Our only goal is to wipe them from the face of the earth - and
        destroy this world of deceit they have created along with them.
Raiden:
        You’re insane.

Vamp:
        Well... it sounds like Arsenal’s ready to go into operation.
Raiden:
        Damn it!
Vamp:
        You’re still hoping that the girl can install that virus that you’re
        carrying around, aren’t you?
Raiden:
        You know --!? (Ocelot told Vamp about it)
Vamp:
        It’s a shame you’re not going to be around long enough to hand her
        the program...

Vamp nods his head toward the water below. The pool below appears on screen.
The surface covered in bubbles, making it nearly impossible to see deeper.

Vamp:
        That isn’t seawater, you know  it’s a byproduct of the microbes
        contained in the pool.

(The density of the water is extremely low as a result of benign aerobic
bacteria taking in the supplied oxygen). Snake explains via Codec.

Vamp:
        Buoyancy is practically non-existent thanks to the high oxygen
        content. Once you fall in, you don’t come up.

Vamp points a finger to the water’s surface and adds:

Vamp:
        Take a good look at your grave.

Following a fierce battle, Raiden defeats Vamp.
Vamp sinks below the pool water’s surface. The pool bubbles over with foam.
Raiden rushes to the side of the pool. The pool looks like its boiling.
Raiden stands over the pool, guarding the water’s surface with his gun.
Suddenly, what sounds almost like a cross between a scream and a battle cry
is heard from the boiling water.

Vamp:
        Haaaarch!

The pool water is stained crimson. Vamp sinks to the bottom and is lost from
sight. Raiden contacts the colonel via Codec.
At this point, Vamp is not dead.

Raiden:
        I’m going after Emma.
Snake:
        We’ll secure the Computer Room.

A sequence showing the President handing over the MO appears on the Codec’s
small screen.

Snake:
        Looks like we can’t install the virus program without Emma.
Raiden:
        Can’t your partner do it?
Otacon:
        --I would if I could. But the security for this system is no joke. I
       need more time...
Snake:
       That’s why we need her.
Raiden:
        Understood. I’ll make sure you have your family reunion...
Otacon:

Raiden:

Otacon:
        A lot of years have passed between EE and me...
Raiden:
        So?
Otacon:
        I don’t have the right to see her.
Snake:
        We can talk about this later. Raiden, I think you’d better get

Shell 2 Core, level B1, Locker Room

After defeating Vamp, Raiden finally arrives at the Locker Room in the
Residential Section located in the B1 level at the core of Shell 2. He opens
the locker in which Emma is hiding. When the locker door opens, Emma
collapses to the bottom of the locker.

Emma:
        (Scream)!

Emma is pretty scared (to the point that she’s wet her pants). Raiden tries
to calm her down. The scene echoes Otacon’s first meeting with Snake.

Raiden:
        Are you alright?

Emma settles down and looks at Raiden for the first time.

Emma:
        Who are you?
Raiden:
        Raiden. I’m getting you out of here.

Emma doesn’t quite believe him.

Emma:
        Get me out...?

Emma, still sitting, confronts Raiden.

Emma:
        You’re lying! Where’re you taking me this time!?

Emma draws back into the locker. Unable to go any further, she cowers against
the wall as if hoping to pass through it.

Raiden:
        What are you talking about!? I’m here to help!
Emma:
        ? (feeling a little overwhelmed by the situation)
Raiden:
        Here - I’ll prove it.

Laying his hand on her neck to touch her Codec.

Raiden:

Emma:

Emma:
        Then you’re not one of them... (not a terrorist)
Raiden:
        That’s what I’ve been trying to tell you.
Emma:
        And you came to rescue me? (Has trouble believing it)
Raiden:
        Actually, I need your help to stop Arsenal... I understand you’re the
        only one who might be able to do it.
Emma:
        And who told you that?
Raiden:
        The President.
Emma:
        ...Really? (Still has trouble believing him)
Raiden:
        I need you to come with me to Shell 1. Your brother’s waiting for you
        there.
Emma:
        My brother?

Emma’s head is whirling.
As she tries to take in the turn of events, a small explosion shakes the
room. The sound of creaking metal reverberates through the chamber. Raiden
stretches a hand out to Emma.

Raiden:
        C’mon! We have to get moving!
Raiden:
        This place’ll be flooded soon!

Raiden takes Emma by the hand and pulls her out of the locker. Emma is
dressed in a two-tone (red/black) tee shirt with black trousers. At first
glance, she almost looks like an underwater diver. Her hair is secured behind
her by two chopsticks. She wears red-framed glasses. An ID card (Card 5)
hangs from her neck. The glasses are not prescription lenses.

Raiden:
        ... (Surprised at how cute she is)

The room shakes again . Water springs from cracks in the ceiling and walls.
(There are leaks, but the water level remains unchanged)

Raiden:
        We’d better move!

Raiden tries to push Emma, who pulls away from him, refusing to move.

Emma:
        I can’t... I can’t swim...

Raiden has already heard about Emma’s fear of water.

Emma:
        How did you know...?

Emma is stunned at the mention of her name and her trauma.

Raiden:
        Your brother told me.
Emma:
        He’s really here?

Putting a comforting hand on Emma’s shoulder, Raiden continues.

Raiden:
        That’s right... he’s here to rescue you.

Shaking off Raiden’s hand, Emma turns away from him.

Emma:
        I don’t believe you! He would never come for me!
Raiden:
        And I’m telling you he’s here - waiting for us at Shell 1!
Emma:
        No! He left me... my mother - when we needed him the most! When my
        father died, all he could think about was himself.

Emma hangs her head in misery.

Raiden:
        Emma, we can go over all that later. But, first, we have to get out
        of here!
Emma:
        No! I hate water!

Like a stubborn child, Emma becomes emotional, screaming her objections.

Emma:
        It’s hopeless! I can’t swim!

From her sitting position, Emma stares at the water’s surface, recalling the
pool accident that claimed her father’s life.

Emma:
        I can’t keep my eyes open in the water... that endless blue...
Emma:
        The water... it wants me... it won’t let me go... (shivering)
Raiden:
        Alright, then close your eyes. I’ll guide you.

Emma tries to come up with some other reason not to swim.

Emma:
        I... I was injected with something! Um... my legs! I have trouble
        moving them! (she was actually injected with truth serum)

Raiden:

Emma:

Raiden:
        Of course I’m sure! That’s how I got here.

have reached the point in front of the stairs (underwater position). They
stand hip-deep in water.

Raiden moves into the water with Emma in tow. Emma grabs Raiden from behind.

Raiden:
        Hang on tight...

Emma holds onto Raiden tightly. The water is at hip level.

Raiden:
        Okay, let’s go!
Emma:
        I’m closing my eyes...

Emma wants some affirmation to take her mind off the water.

Raiden learns how cute Emma is when she removes her glasses.

Raiden:
        You know... you should wear contacts.
Emma:
        There’s nothing wrong with my eyes.
Raiden:

Emma:
        I wear them for show.
Raiden:

Emma:
        No, it’s not like that. I like glasses. And there’s this guy I liked
        who used to wear them.
Raiden:

Emma’s legs are still bothering her. She’s curled up in a sitting position.

Not sure whether her response is a rejection or welcome, he isn’t sure what

Reacting to Otacon’s words, Emma takes on a harder approach.

        Cat got your tongue? (Playfully. Knowing that he thought she was ‘just
        a girl’)
Raiden:
        Sorry, I... how about the ‘Patriots’? Ever heard of ‘em?
Emma:
        Yes. But I only know what I’ve been told.
Raiden:
        (Didn’t imagine Emma was in so deep) Can you tell me what you know?
Emma:
        Uh, sure. But it’s hard to put into words.

        Right... (recalls internal communication

Raiden:
        Are you reading me, Emma?
Emma:
        Yes -- loud and clear.
Raiden:
        The President said that Arsenal Gear was the Patriots’ key to
        supremacy.
Emma:
        ...That’s as good as a description as any.
Raiden:
        What exactly is it?
Emma:
        It’s a massive data processing system capable of controlling
        information on a global scale.
Raiden:
        A data processing system...? (Thought it was a weapon)
Emma:
        That’s right. The system’s a social device for maintaining the
        Patriots’ control.
Raiden:
        You’ve lost me.
Emma:
        In this day and age, information emerges from every direction, and is
        freely distributed...
Emma:
        A variety of information - gathered by servers employing the latest
        in high-speed communication networks and P2P technology - is rapidly
        circulated to individuals. In fact, the speed of the circulation
        process is accelerating on an almost daily basis.
Emma:
        That Patriots seem to be afraid of this development. Apparently, they
        believe that their role will shift from dominant to dominated.
Raiden:
        ?
Emma:
        Let me give you an example. You’re aware of Solid Snake’s Anti-Metal
        Gear activities, aren’t you?
Raiden:
        Yeah -I know a little about it.
Emma:
        That’s just a small example of uncontrolled information. I can
        guarantee you the Patriots did not want Solid Snake’s name
        publicized.
Emma:
        Now look at it like this... political scandal, corporate
        corruption... up till now, the Patriots have managed to keep a lid on
        these and other self-serving events. But with their existing data
        processing system, they are no longer able to effectively control the
        flow of information generated at an individual level.
Emma:
        With the newly created system, they can fully regulate the digital
        information. High-level info can be categorized in stages, given
        clearance levels, and deleted as necessary - never to be seen by the
        public. By deleting such info, the Patriots can shape the course of
        history as they see fit.
Raiden:
        Somebody’s bound to catch on --
Emma:
        No. The memory capacity - not to mention the lifespan - of the
        average individual is extremely limited. On the other hand, digital
        information lasts virtually forever... it doesn’t deteriorate.
Raiden:
        So...?
Emma:
        The alphabet... 26 letters, right? It could’ve been 30 letters. What
        if the 4 deleted letters were controlled by a program?
Raiden:
        Impossible.
Emma:
        It’s not. In fact, something similar is already underway. Do you know
        how many genes exist in an individual?
Raiden:
        About 30 to 40 thousand.
Emma:
        Right. That’s what was announced at the end of the century. But
        there’s actually 100 thousand, according to the original theory
        advanced by the scientific community. Information regarding the
        remaining 60 thousand was suppressed by the Patriots.
Raiden:
        No...
Emma:
        Why? How would you know? Do you know what a gene looks like? Did you
        count them yourself?
Raiden:
        There are research organizations... (they’d realize)
Emma:
        Of course... and their reports have already been subtly altered.
        They’re even beginning to believe the doctored reports. GW is a
        system that allows the Patriots to decide what will be recorded in
        tomorrow’s history.
Raiden:
         So what we’re talking about here is one huge censorship system for
         deleting information which might be inconvenient for the Patriots?
Emma:
        Exactly. The actual, physical core for handling the task GW- is
        installed in Arsenal. It’s the only system in the world with an optic
        neural AI that has a parallel processing capacity of 980 trillion
        hammets. (A unit coined to express levels of complexity)
Raiden:
        I supposed that being a specialist in neural AI and complex logic
        played a role in your association with the Metal Gear project?
Emma:
        That’s not the only reason... (this is in reference to her feelings
        for Otacon)
Raiden:
        What do you mean?
Emma:
        ...(blushing)
Raiden:
        I guess there’re plenty of other reasons. (Raiden is incapable of
        dealing with the feelings of others. Hence, he pretends to understand
        but isn’t really aware of what’s going on.)
Emma:
        Yes, there are - (Actually, she’s hoping he’ll ask)
Raiden:
        I understand.
Emma:
        Do you? (She feels like he’s sidestepped the issue. She thinks that
        he wouldn’t be able to begin to understand her feelings.)
Raiden:
        So Arsenal Gear was actually designed to protect the GW system,
        wasn’t it? (Raiden fails to recognize Emma’s emotional state.)
Emma:
        Uh... yes. It’s armed with everything including nuclear weapons, and
        is fully equipped with cyber-terrorist countermeasures. Physically
        and logically, it’s the ultimate fortress for housing GW.
Raiden:
        But is the AI actually capable of controlling everything?
Emma:
        No. GW is only the system’s core. The actual sub-system for executing
        the task exists with our social structure...
Raiden:
        What!?

Raiden:

Emma:
        That’s right. If you recall, our won government supplied the world
        with a countermeasure program  using the internet at full capacity.
        The program was distributed to every governmental organization...
        every key facility... throughout the world. In addition, the same
        program was included in an OS application for distribution among the
        public.

Emma:
        Do you know how a computer operates? Do you really know the basic
        principles of how data is exchanged?
Raiden:

Emma:
        Nobody’s aware of it, but there’s a sub-system in place. And its
        about to be activated.
Raiden:
        Is that why Solidus wants to burn out every electrical circuit in
        Manhattan with a nuclear blast?
Emma:
        Probably. But the overall system isn’t actually complete.
Raiden:
        What?
Emma:
        It still lacks the necessary factors for judging situations. I heard
        they were planning a major experiment in the next few days, to
        provide complex data for the GW to study. (Emma doesn’t know that
        this incident is actually a part of the experiment, which is
        codenamed the S3 Plan.)
Emma:

        Right now, with Arsenal’s boarding in progress, security should be at

        understand what she’s doing)
Snake:
        You’d better hurry - I don’t think she’s going to make it.
Raiden:
        How’s the bleeding?
Snake:
        She’s...
Snake:

Shell 1, level B2, Computer Room

Fade in. Raiden finally arrives at the Computer Room.
Otacon holds Emma’s hand as he holds her up in his arms. Emma lies there
exhausted. Otacon ignores Raiden as he enters the room. Snake stands
alongside a computer terminal.

Raiden:
        How’s Emma?

Snake looks in Emma’s direction.

Snake:
        I think he got some internal organs...

Emma’s back and abdomen are soaked in red.
The two men stand at a distance from Emma and Otacon.

Snake:
        We can’t stop the bleeding.

Otacon has tears in his eyes.

Emma:
        Hh... Hal?

Her sight failing her, Emma reaches out with her hands to find Otacon.

Otacon:
        I’m here...

Otacon tries to comfort a shivering Emma. Snake pulls his eyes away from Emma
and chokes out a whisper.

Snake:
        Got the disc?

Raiden shows Snake the MO disc.
Snake nods his head. Snake jerks his head towards the computer terminal.

Snake:
        Emma’s set everything up. Apparently, all you have to do is pop in
        the disc. (He doesn’t really understand how it all works)

Taking the disc from Raiden, Snake inserts it into the terminal. A screen is
displayed showing the data being loaded from the MO disc to Arsenal’s AI.

Snake:
        Um... that should insert the virus into the AI... (But he’s not
        really sure)

A bar on the screen continues to extend, indicating that the LOAD is
proceeding.

Raiden:
        Is it working?
Snake:
        Just leave it to Emma. (He hasn’t got the faintest idea)

According to the on-screen bar, 80% of the data has been loaded. Suddenly, a
warning virus rings out! A virus detection program has been activated. A
warning appears on the display screen.

Snake:
        What the --!?

Snake turns to Otacon. With Emma still in his arms, Otacon looks toward the
screen.

Otacon:
        An antibody agent!?

A disconnection notice appears on the display screen.

Snake:
        Damn! The connections been cut!

Snake and Raiden close around the screen.

Raiden:
        Is the virus upload complete?
Snake:
        I don’t think so. The count’s stopped at 90%.

90% is displayed on the screen.

Snake:
        Otacon...? (What’s going on?)
Otacon:
        I don’t think Emma’s made any mistakes...
Raiden:
        But...
Otacon:
        A portion of the worm cluster might’ve been altered after the disc
        left Emma’s hands.
Raiden:
        By the Patriots? (The Patriots had modified the program so it would
        wipe any data regarding their existence)
Snake:
        Will the virus work?
Otacon:
        I have no idea...

Raiden and Snake look at each other. The terminal’s monitor screen is
displayed.

The monitor screen cuts off.

Unaware of the situation, Emma begins to mumble. Snake takes the disc out of
the terminal.

Emma:
        Hal... It’s alright. Everything’s alright.

With her hearing now failing her, Emma hasn’t heard the exchange between
Snake and company. Otacon looks at Snake as if to ask how he should reply.
Snake shakes his head.

Otacon:
        Uh... it’s alright. Everything’s alright.
Emma:
        Good... At least I... I won’t be adding... another page to our
        family’s dark... history...

Historically, Otacon’s lineage consists of scientists engaged in the
development of evil weapons. Otacon’s grandfather was involved in the
Manhattan Project.

Otacon:
        Yeah... that’s right...

Snake approaches Raiden and they both whisper so that Emma can’t hear their
exchange.

Raiden:
        What if the virus doesn’t work?
Snake:
        Either destroy that thing or take our Solidus and his men.
Raiden:
        How do we get on board?
Snake:
        I don’t think we can, unless somebody inside gives us a hand.

Snake hints at Olga’s existence. Emma’s condition deteriorates. Abnormal
things are happening on the surface of the sea surrounding the plant. With
the last of her strength, Emma tightly grips Otacon’s hand.

Emma:
        Hal, I... I always...
Otacon:
        What is it?

Emma has trouble forming the words. She reaches out and touches Otacon’s
glasses.

Emma:
        ...wanted to see you again...

Otacon:

Emma:

        you... I thought that with Arsenal... if I followed in your
        footsteps... I could be... closer.
Emma:

A number of minutes have passed following Emma’s death. As if aware that Emma
has passed away, her caged parrot starts squawking. Putting on his glasses,
Otacon reaches out to the parrot. The bird moves onto Otacon’s hand.

Parrot:
        Hal.

Otacon approaches the birdcage and gingerly removes the parrot.

Parrot:
        Hal.

Gently holding the parrot in both hands, Otacon crumbles into tears.

Otacon:
        (Sob!)

Suddenly, the facility echoes with an announcement from an enemy commander.

Announcer:
        Attention! Arsenal Gear is ready for launch! Evacuate the upper
        levels immediately!
Snake:
        Sounds like they’re cutting this area loose!
Raiden:
        What do you mean?

Otacon suddenly starts crying and speaks up. His white jacket is stained red
with Emma’s blood.

Otacon:
        It means we’re gonna sink...
Snake:
        We have to get the hostages out!
Raiden:
        What about the Kamov repairs?
Otacon:
        Done...
Raiden:
        We won’t be able to get everybody aboard...
Snake:
        We’ll just have to take as many as we can.
Otacon:

Otacon glances at Emma and comes to a decision.

Otacon:
        ...won’t be able to come with us. (convinces himself)
Announcer:
        We will be commencing the countdown shortly...
Announcer:

Otacon:
        What about you guys?
Snake:
        We got other arrangements...
Otacon:
        ?

Raiden turns towards Snake as if to ask what the other arrangements might
be.

Snake:
        There’s our ride out of here.

Snake points a finger at the massive access hatch of Arsenal Gear, which can
be seen from a nearby window.

Snake:
        Anyway, we’re going to have to sink that thing if the virus doesn’t
        work.
Otacon:
        I should be going with you.

Snake shakes his head in refusal.

Snake:
        You’ve got your job, we’ve got ours.
Otacon:
        You mean I’d only get in your way... (Feeling bitter about his
        helplessness)
Snake:
        Wrong. Only you can save those hostages. Got it?

Gripping Otacon by his shoulders, Snake reassures him. Smiling, Otacon, nods
his head.

Otacon:
        Yeah... right...

Otacon addresses the two men.

Otacon:
        Listen. The two of you won’t be able to destroy that thing.

Otacon speaks to Snake.

Otacon:
        Eliminate the enemy... That’s your only option.

Snake and company walk out of the room.

Shell 1 Core, level B2, In front of the AG access hatch.
The men stop in front of Arsenal’s access hatch. The entry looks solid and
secure. A nearby sign reads Arsenal Gear  No Unauthorized Entry
(tentative). Raiden looks at Snake. Snake gives a slight nod of the head. The
parrot cries out again.

Parrot:
        Hal...
Parrot:
        Hal...
Parrot:
        Hal...
Parrot:

The parrot chants as if performing an incantation. Otacon lets out a primal
scream.

Otacon:
        EE... Damn...!! Aaauuuh!

Venting his pain and sorrow, Otacon rams his head against the wall.

Snake:
        Otacon! Try to get as many hostages out as you can. It’s a short
        flight to the shore, so don’t worry about overloading the Kamov.
Otacon:
        Leave it to me.

Snake and Otacon embrace each other.

Announcer:
        ...I repeat! Personnel in the upper levels... head for the evacuation
        area immediately!

The evacuation announcement is repeated over the speakers.

Snake:
        I’m counting on you, Otacon.

With the parrot in his arms, Otacon heads for the elevator. Otacon disappears
behind the closing doors of the elevator.
The elevator goes up.

Parrot:
        Hal... I miss you...

Alone in the small compartment, Otacon breaks down and weeps openly.

Parrot:
        I miss you... I miss you...

Otacon cries out again in agony. He addresses the parrot as if it were Emma.

Shell 1 core, level B2, In front of the AG Entrance

Front of Arsenal’s Entrance. Raiden and Snake have seen Otacon off. Without a
word, Snake hands Raiden the virus disc. (The disc is actually a fake)

Raiden:
        You think he’s gonna be okay?
Snake:
        He’s tougher that he looks. Consider it done.
Raiden:
        Now. How do we open this thing?

Snake grins.

Snake:
        You can come out now!

On Snake’s signal, a ninja (Olga) drops from the ceiling.

Raiden:
        A ninja...? What the...?
Ninja:
        Arsenal’s going to take off.

Raiden tries to ask Snake what’s going on. Expressionless, Snake simply
ignores him.

Ninja:
        We still need you to take care of a few things...

Drawing the sword from the scabbard at her hip, Olga holds Raiden back. The
sword point is held directly in front of Raiden’s eyes.

Ninja:
        This time, do not fail us.
Raiden:
        Snake! What’s this all about!?

There is no response from Snake, who stands at ease nearby.

Snake:
        Bed time, Raiden.
Raiden:
        !

Raiden’s hand goes for his gun.

Snake:
        I wouldn’t do that!
Raiden:
        You’re changing sides now!?
Snake:
        Changing sides? I don’t recall saying I was on yours.
Raiden:
        Damn it.

The Ninja switches off her face shield. The shield clears up to reveal Olga’s
face.

Raiden:
        You!
Olga:
        Ready for some shuteye?

Olga renders Raiden unconscious with her sword.

Raiden:
        Ungh!

The nanomachines in Raiden resonate with Olga’s sword, releasing plasma
bolts. In short, by using the nanomachines inside Raiden, Olga is able to
render him unconscious. This is explained via standard radio.

Arsenal goes into operation! Shell 1 and 2 are flooded upon being cut loose!
Dark waters flood in from all sides! The sea bubbles up as something huge
climbs to the surface. Sitting behind the controls of the Kamov, Otacon

Movie

Raiden regains consciousness in a torture chamber. It is a first-person scene
that fades in slowly. As in the previous game, the ceiling of the chamber can
be seen. Although Raiden cannot see himself at this point, he has been
stripped naked. Similar to the torture machine in the previous game, his arms
and legs are restrained and is a prisoner of Ocelot.
The torture chamber is depicted with the same model graphics(or similar
image) as the previous game. He is already inside Arsenal Gear. Ambient
sounds similar to that of a submarine running underwater can be heard.
Solidus and Ocelot are also in the torture chamber.
Raiden’s eyes are locked on the ceiling as he hears the voices of Solidus and
Ocelot echo in his ears. The two believe that Raiden is still unconscious. A
flashback montage(movie) will be prepared using the torture scene from MGS
(recorded from the previous game). From the user’s view, Solidus will look
like Liquid. In between, this game’s first-person sequence will be filmed and
inserted. Voices will be modified with an echo effect. At the outset,
everything is dark.

Solidus:
        Is he alive?
Ocelot:
        He was when Olga brought him in.

Fade in slowly. Ocelot(from the previous game) stands in front of Raiden.

Ocelot:
        I’ve checked everything including the Genome data, but there’s
        nothing on this guy.
Ocelot:
        NSA, CIA, FBI... he doesn’t exist in any database.
Ocelot:
        He’s a non-existent operative from a non-existent organization.
Solidus:
        I suspected as much. However, I know this man...
Ocelot:
        ?
Solidus:
        Wake him up.

The movie sequence plays up to this point.

AG Torture Chamber

Ocelot switches on the torture bed(sound insert).

The bed on which Raiden is restrained rises to an upright position. As the
sequence is played out in the first-person, the scenery rises into view.
During this period, control input is possible though this sequence is a demo.
By raising the bed, the first-person view of the ceiling shifts over to a
full view of the room in which the torture bed is located. The room is
partitioned by glass and is equipped with the latest in medical equipment.
Past the glass, steel bars  like a prison  can be seen. Cables emerge from
the foot of the torture bed, sprawling across the floor like arteries. (same
specs as in the previous game)

When the bed is upright, Solidus becomes visible. Solidus is wearing a black
suit (powered), which resembles a suit of armor. He wears what appears to be
a muffler (snake-like tentacle) around his neck and an eye patch over his
left eye (injury from the Harrier event). Seeing Raiden’s face, he approaches
a dew steps. With the eye patch, he looks just like Big Boss. Moreover, he
looks exactly like Snake.

He looks at Raiden as if he’s gazing at an old friend. Puffs of white vapor
appear each time Solidus and Ocelot breathe out.

Solidus:
        It’s been a while, hasn’t it... Jack the Ripper?
Ocelot:
        You know this fellow?

Quickly glaring at Ocelot, Solidus turns back to Raiden.

Solidus:
        You remember me, don’t you?

Solidus addresses him like an old friend, but Raiden doesn’t reply.

Solidus:
        You’ve grown.

The tentacle around Solidus’ neck stretches out and wraps itself around
Raiden’s neck. At this point, all directional input is disabled in the first-
person sequence.

Raiden:
        (Gasps for breath)

Another snake tentacle extends from Solidus to lightly scan Raiden’s mind.
The first-person view suddenly flashes!

Solidus:
        High-concentration of cerebral implants... (delivered with a mixture
        of pity and scorn) Have they altered your memory, too?

Solidus is referring to the intravenous nanomachines in Raiden. The
nanomachines are capable of memory manipulation through connecting or
stimulating synapses. By arranging a nerve circuit within the dormant portion
of the brain, the nanomachines generate a vision of the Colonel. This is
explained later.

Raiden:
        Aaaaaaarghaah!!! (screams and groans)

Rubbing the edge of his eye patch, Solidus reminisces.

Solidus:
        Jack... I never thought I’d see you again...
Raiden:
        You know me? (similar situation to Snake in the previous game)

Solidus:
        When you were barely ten years old, you became the platoon leader of
        the ‘small boy unit’. At the time, your outstanding kill record
        earned you several nicknames, including ‘White Devil’ and ‘Jack the

        you... I should have know they would recruit you.

With their backs to Raiden, Ocelot and Solidus speak to each other. Behind
them, Raiden listens to their conversation. Raiden is naked.

Ocelot:
        It’s an interesting coincidence... (He knows it wasn’t a coincidence
        at all.)
Solidus:
        If he’s a lackey for the Patriots, I doubt that he knows anything of
        interest.
Ocelot:
        What should we do with him?
Solidus:
        We’ll use him like you suggested... (Use Raiden as bait to draw out
        any Patriots’ spies who have infiltrated their organization)

They look at Raiden’s face.

Ocelot:
        What about Dead Cell?
Solidus:
        Ignore them.

Snake is nearby, triggering pain in Ocelot’s wrist.
Ocelot bits down hard on his right arm to regain self-control.

Solidus:
        Happening again?

Seeing ocelot’s condition, Solidus curtly comments.

Ocelot:
        Could it be that he’s here too? (Emphasis on ‘he’)
Solidus:
        Hmph. (Convinced that there are traitors among his men)

Understanding Solidus’ response, Ocelot starts walking.

Solidus:
        In another hour, we demonstrate the power of Arsenal Gear.
Ocelot:
        Attack with standard weapons, of course? (A diversionary effort
        making it look like they intend to attack?)
Solidus:
        Yes. We proceed as planned.
Ocelot:
        At last report, all is well with ‘GW’.
Solidus:
        Hm. (seemingly satisfied) How about our troops?
Ocelot:
        The men are being outfitted with Arsenal Gear equipment as ordered.

Ocelot looks at Solidus’ eye patch.

Ocelot:
        You’re the spitting image of Big Boss.

Solidus laughs loudly.

Solidus:
        Ha, ha, ha... Is that so? Perhaps I should ve grateful to this kid
        for that.

Solidus leaves through the south door. His departure is executed in a similar
manner as Liquid in the previous game. Raiden is left alone with Ocelot.

Ocelot approaches Raiden.

Ocelot:
        This situation... I find it very... nostalgic.
Raiden:
        Where am I?

Raiden is starting to recover.

Ocelot:
        Why, inside Arsenal of course.

Glances up at the ceiling. Arsenal Gear is cruising under the sea.

Ocelot:
        Actually, we’re also inside the memory of Shadow Moses.

Ocelot views Raiden’s naked figure. He pulls an MO disc out of his pocket and
holds it up for Raiden to see.

Ocelot:
        I’ll take this back. You don’t need this anymore, do you?

Ocelot puts away the MO disc.
Following his cryptic comments, he steals the MO. (He works for the Patriots)
Since the Patriots have lost Arsenal Gear to Solidus - their plans did not
include the launch - they hope to stop it by destroying the AI with the
virus.

Olga enters the room. She’s wearing the same outfit as in the Big Shell
Chapter. Ocelot breaks off his conversation with Raiden.

Ocelot:
        A foul wind is blowing... We shall speak again.

Olga and Ocelot don’t get along. Olga doesn’t know that Ocelot works for the
Patriots. Ocelot leaves the room.

Raiden glares at Olga.

Olga:
        Don’t move.

Following the whispered command, Olga checks the vicinity.

Olga:
        Stay as you are...

Olga doesn’t face the camera.

Olga:
        We’re being monitored by a camera.

There’s an active security camera on the ceiling. Olga stands with her back
turned to it. Her expression cannot be seen with the camera.

Raiden:
        What are you up to?
Olga:
        I’m switching over to nanocommunication.

Olga:
        Correct... it’s me.
Raiden:
        I thought you were the leader of the Russian troops...
Olga:
        No. (A tortured expression) That was just a smoke screen.
Raiden:
        A smoke screen?
Olga:
        I was sent to provide you support.
Raiden:
        Support? Who sent you? The Colonel?
Olga:
        No... The Patriots.
Raiden:
        What!?
Olga:
        I... I deceived my troops... betrayed them...
Raiden:
        But why?
Olga:
        My child is... being held hostage by the Patriots.
Olga:
        It all started 2 years ago when I lost my father (Sergei) during the
        tanker incident.
Olga:
        My men(Gurlukovich’s troops) and I had nowhere to go... So we joined
        forces with an illegal Russian organization.
Raiden:
        The Russian Mafia?
Olga:
        Something like that. Actually, I learned much later that it was a
        subordinate organization to the Patriots.
Olga:
        I was expecting at the time. When I gave birth to my child, it turned
        out I was in a hospital run by the Patriots. In the morning... my
        child was gone. My baby is being kept somewhere in this country.
Raiden:
        Have you even met your child?
Olga:
        No. Once a month, they send me a photo of my child via network. I’ve
        never even held the child in my own arms...
Raiden:
        I see... (Actually, Raiden understands very little about a mother’s
        feelings for her child)
Raiden:
        Given your situation, nobody can blame you for what you did.
Olga:
        That’s your opinion... (Olga believes she’s accountable for her
        betrayal)
Raiden:
        What about Snake? I thought you two were enemies...
Olga:
        He wasn’t responsible for my father’s death. Actually, we owe him our
        lives.

Raiden:
        So you were partners since the incident?
Olga:
        No. I only found out the truth shortly before this.
Raiden:
        Huh?
Olga:
        When I confronted him here...
Raiden:
        You fought with Snake!? When?

Raiden:
        (a little sarcastically) So you joined hands with him to pay back a
        debt?
Olga:
        No. Mutual gain...
Raiden:
        (A little surprised to hear that comment from a native of a communist
        country) Mutual Gain?
Olga:
        My job was to assist you. If Solidus gets away with Arsenal, your
        mission is a failure. The Patriots would judge that as failure on my
        part and terminate my child. Putting it simply, my child’s life
        depends on your success.
Raiden:
        So you did it all for your child. But why would the Patriots want to
        help me? Are they hoping I’ll take Solidus out?
Olga:
        No. You’re just like me... we’re just pawns...
Raiden:
        Pawns for what purpose?
Olga:
        The S3 plan...
Raiden:
        ?
Olga:
        You’ll figure it out sooner or later -- but I wonder if you’ll
        handle the truth? (She’s talking about Rose)
Raiden:
        What do you mean?
Olga:
        Listen... we haven’t got the time for this. Solidus will commence his
        attack any minute. He’s got to be stopped.
Raiden:
        What about the virus?
Olga:
        No results so far. I think the Patriots have tampered with the
        program.
Raiden:
        Will it work?
Olga:
        I don’t know...
Raiden:
        Get me out of this thing.
Olga:
        Not yet. I’ll release your restraints after I leave this room.
Raiden:
        Where’s my gear?
Olga:
        Snake’s got everything. I couldn’t bring it here.
Raiden:

Raiden:

Olga:
        No. Even for Snake, its impossible to completely destroy this thing.
        The only option is to stop Solidus and his men.
Raiden:

Olga:

Raiden:
        Oh, y-yeah.(Uncomfortable with the revelation of his past)
Rose:
        Jack, is it true? What Solidus said?
Raiden:
        ...Yes.
Rose:
        It’s unbelievable... Drafting small children and sending them to war.
        - it’s not allowed under international conventions.
Raiden:
        ICC rules don’t mean a lot in war. Someone told me that there are
        over three hundred thousand children (under 18) in combat right now.
        I was just one of them...
Rose:
        So you remember? I thought your memory had been... manipulated by
        them.
Raiden:
        It was —- but I have nightmares every day, pieces of the past I can’t
        put together...
Rose:
        Why didn’t you tell me?
Raiden:
        You couldn’t begin to understand.
Rose:
        You wouldn’t know that until you try me.
Raiden:
        I didn’t want you to get hurt. (A lie. He was protecting himself, not
        her.)
Rose:
        ...
Raiden:
        There was never any real reason for me to fight, except that someone
        put a gun in my hand. And that someone was him(Solidus)...
Rose:
        It wasn’t your fault.
Raiden:
        If I survived the day’s fight, I was praised, fed and had a bed o
        sleep in. I think I was only six when I held my first AK, but I’m not
        even sure of that.
Rose:
        Jack?
Raiden:
        I’m not like Snake. I never questioned why we fought. There was no
        purpose, no way out. They give you a gun, you ask how many to kill.
        If you didn’t, you were the one they shot instead.
Rose:
        It’s OK. No one is blaming you.
Raiden:
        We were shown Hollywood action films every day. The kind with macho
        guys and big guns. They call it image training. Played war games too.
        But with real bullets.
Rose:
        ...
Raiden:
        They - they built us from the ground up, into killing machines...
Raiden:
        We were fed once a day. I can still taste the gunpowder they mixed
        into the food.
Rose:
        Gunpowder? In the food?
Raiden:
        The gunpowder had toluene in it - giving it hallucinogenic
        properties. It kept us drugged, controllable.
Rose:
        Oh my God...

Rose starts to sob.

Raiden:
        When the civil war ended, those of us who survived were taken in by
        NGO’s. they gave me a new life in the States. I can’t complain.
Raiden:
        But nothing’s changed (Slightly choked voice). The only people who
        have no problem with my past have secrets and agendas of their own.
Raiden:
        Terrible nightmares - every night. I can never forget...
Rose:
        Jack... (weeping)
Raiden:
        I’m afraid of the night. That’s why I don’t sleep next to you.
        (Hoarsely)
Rose:
        You should have told me... (weeping)
Raiden:
        Told you what? That I’m a killer and always have been?
Rose:
        No, no.
Raiden:
        What I hate more than anything else in the world is my own past. I
        didn’t want you  -- or anyone - to know about it.
Rose:
        ... (the weeping has intensified)
Raiden:
        Now I know why I was chosen for this mission. No one can take him
        (Solidus) on - take him down - except me.
Raiden:
        I’ve been kept alive this long for this. I knew, as soon as I saw
        Solidus.
Rose:
        Jack, I love you the way that you are now. You have to believe me.
Raiden:
        ...
Rose:
        I didn’t know anything about you, I admit that. Where you were born,
        how you grew up - but I know that now. And I know that what I feel
        for you can only get better, and I’ll share in your past if that’s
        the price.
Raiden:
        It doesn’t work that way. No one can share the burden of what I’ve
        done. It’s not one of those warm and fuzzy things couples share.
Rose:
        I accept the good and the bad, Jack. That’s what you do for someone
        you love.
Raiden:
        I don’t want to share my past with anyone. I just want to forget
        about what I’ve done...
Rose:
        (she checks herself, falls silent)
Raiden:
        The last two years with you - it’s been more than I’ve ever hoped
        for.
Rose:
        Jack...
Raiden:
        But I can’t go any farther.
Raiden:

Rose:

Raiden:
        If it’s about the conversation just now, I’m the one who’s sorry.
Rose:
        No, it’s something else.
Raiden:
        What is it?
Rose:
        That day at Federal hall two years ago - it wasn’t a
        coincidence.(Exactly two years ago, as it will be clarified at the
        end)
Rose:

Raiden:
        Keep an eye on me?
Rose:
        Yes - by the Patriots.
Raiden:

Rose:
        I fell in love with you...

Rose:
        (Emphatically) I can’t excuse what I did. I’ve reported every detail
        of your personal life to them these two years. What you did, what you
        said, everything.
Raiden:
        Must’ve been fun.
Rose:

Raiden:

Rose:
        Like what I felt for you.
Raiden:
        (Purposely cold) So hat’s why you were involved in this mission. I
        should have known. Why else would they toss an analyst into the mix
        at the last minute.
Rose:
        I’m sorry. I know what I did was wrong...
Raiden:
        No matter where I go - I get used.
Rose:
        I reinvented myself to suit your tastes. Hairstyle, clothes, the way
        I moved, things I talked about...
Rose:
        You say you love the color of my hair, my eyes. They’re not even
        real. (her hair is dyed and she wears colored contacts)
Raiden:

Rose:
        What I really wanted was for you to see the real me. It hurt to play

        It was worse to lie to myself than you. The more love you gave me,
        the more it hurt  because I knew the person you loved was just a
        character.
Raiden:
        So it was artificial on my end too. It was just a game, not the real
        thing. (as if trying to convince himself)
Rose:
        Oh Jack...
Raiden:
        I fell better knowing that.
Rose:
        (puzzled) What?
Raiden:
        I was in love --  or I thought I was - with someone who didn’t
        exist. I was trying to be someone I wasn’t by loving what wasn’t
        real.
Raiden:
        I don’t know who you really are. The person I knew isn’t real; she’s
        not the woman I’m talking to right now. In a sense, the deception was
        my own, not yours.
Rose:
        Jack, I thought I was acting, because that was my job. But I did fall
        in love with you, that wasn’t an act.
Raiden:
        You expect me to believe that.
Rose:
        ...
Raiden:
        It’s okay. You had your reasons, right? Hey, I understand. But I have
        nothing left to (say to you)...
Rose:

Raiden:
        What?
Rose:

Rose:
        I’m pregnant, Jack.

Rose’s voice Starts to go buggy, losing speed a la HAL9000’s demise scene.

Rose:

Raiden:

End Contact with Rose. Data can be saved, but the character of Rose no longer

        Amazing how you walk around like that.

Look towards the direction of the voice and there stands Snake in his
Sneaking Suit. His voice is low, hushed against enemy hearing. Snake is
leaning against a wall to the south (behind) of Raiden, (arms crossed).

Raiden:
        Snake!
Snake:
        Been waiting long?

Snake wears the familiar bandana on his head, which is rippling despite the
absence of any breeze. This is the familiar Snake of old, beloved of fans.
Use the Snake character from the Tanker Chapter. Raiden lets out a sneeze
from the cold.

Raiden:
        Ah-choo!! Where’s my gear?

Snake points to Raiden’s weapons and equipment. An Item Box is revolving on

        (calmly) Sorry about earlier, I had to use you as bait to gain access
        to Arsenal. It worked (cheerfully).
Raiden:
        Why didn’t you tell me about Olga?
Snake:
        You never asked.
Raiden:
        Uh! (P.O.’d)
Snake:
        Hot happy about that? Get over it.
Raiden:
        (still not pleased) ...any effects of the virus yet?
Snake:
        Still waiting on that.
Raiden:
        So it (the virus) was rigged by the Patriots?
Snake:
        Looks like it. From what I can tell, Arsenal is headed for Manhattan.
        I don’t know what Arsenal is planning, but we’ll have to deal with
        it, one way or another.
Snake:
        There’s also a troop of production model RAYs ahead.
Raiden:
        How many units?
Snake:
        25, according to Olga.
Raiden:
        25!?
Snake:
        Yeah, can’t say that I’ve faced that many Metal Gears before, but 
        I think we can deal.
Raiden:
        (pessimistic) No way we can...
Snake:
        (Evenly) We can because we have no other choice.
Raiden:

Raiden:

Snake:

Raiden:
        I’m not sure. Sometimes it’s hard to tell the difference between
        reality and a game...
Snake:
        Diminished sense of reality, huh? VR training will do that.
Raiden:
        No, it was field-training, when I was a kid.
Raiden:
        I lied, Snake. I have more field-experience than I can remember. It’s
        not VR that’s doing it to me.
Snake:
        Raiden, we don’t carry guns to take people down. We’re not here to
        help some politician either.
Raiden:
        You can say that because you’re a legend, a hero. I’m Jack the Ripper,

        Inside Arsenal.
Raiden:
        What!?
Otacon:
        I’ve checked out all the possibilities, but I keep coming back to
        Arsenal. It isn’t a relay point, it’s the origin of the signal.
Raiden:
        ...
Otacon:
        And, the encryption protocol it uses is exactly the same as that of
        Arsenal’s AI - the so-called GW.
Raiden:
        ...What does this mean?
Otacon:
        I think it means you’ve been talking to an AI
Raiden:
        That’s impossible!
Otacon:
        The Colonel probably isn’t GW per se. GW was most likely stimulating
        cortical activity in the dormant part of your brain through signal
        manipulation of your own nanomachines. The colonel is in part your own
        creation, cobbled together from expectation and experience...
Raiden:
        That’s crazy...
Otacon:
        But it’s probably the truth. The virus may be starting to affect GW,
        which would explain the Colonel’s behavior.

take a moment to collect themselves. Sudden footsteps ring out. Fortune
languidly enters the room from the same hallway that Raiden and Snake walked
down. Tears streak her melancholic face. The linear rifle is slung over one
shoulder. Sensing others in the room, she turns around. Raiden and Snake grow
tense at the sight of her. Fortune steps up onto the cylindrical elevator.

Solidus:
        S3 stands for Solid Snake Simulation... it’s a development program to
        artificially reproduce Solid Snake, the perfect warrior. The result

taken by surprise. Raiden aims his gun a moment too late.

Solidus:
        See you in hell!
Olga:
        HRRRRGH!!

Olga turns the barrel of her gun towards Solidus with a cry of rage. Before
she can pull the trigger, one of Solidus’ tentacles fly out at blinding speed
and knock her arm out of the way. The bullets hit the ceiling instead of their
intended target while the other tentacle grabs Olga by the throat. She gasps
in pain.

Olga:

Olga is lifted off the ground. Solidus twirls the P90 in his hand like
something out of a Spaghetti western. Olga throws a pleading look (‘make my
death count’ type of look) towards Raiden.

Olga:

Slow-motion. The P90 stops its rotation and the trigger is pulled back. A
single gunshot blasts through the air, and Olga’s body goes flying. Blood and

Raiden falls to his knees with shock. He is paralyzed by the terrible turn of
events. Solidus turns to Raiden and grins. The tentacles have already been
wrapped around his throat.

Solidus:
        Enjoy the show, Jack? Let’s pick up where we left off.

Solidus signals toward the ceiling (Ocelot). The RAYs start to move again.
However, they are not acting the way they should.

Solidus:
        Hm?

Their movements are clumsy, almost convulsive.

Solidus:
        What’s going on!?

A RAY shakes its head like a broken toy. Solidus calls Ocelot.

Solidus:
        What’s wrong with it!
Ocelot:
        The AI  GW  it’s out of control.
Solidus:
        What!?

The RAYs break into a frenzy of uncontrollable movements.

The RAYs have red blood; once they bleed, they start attacking one another (a
bug in their cognitive routine). Totally out of control, they close in on
Solidus.

Solidus:
        Stupid machines!

Solidus snaps shut his steel collar and turns his muscle suit on.

Solidus:
        RrrRRAAAAH!

Harnessing the accelerator, he deftly evades the RAYs’ lashing tails while
sniping out their AI control center with the P90. The RAYs come to a stop.

Solidus:
        Damn the Patriots!

Solidus grabs Raiden (with a tentacle) and lifts him off his feet. Solidus is
about to kill him, but changes his mind.

Solidus:
        You still have some use...

Solidus puts his P90 down. Raiden is unresisting, completely sapped of his
will to fight. Suddenly, Fortune’s voice calls out.

Fortune:
        I’ve captured Snake.

Solidus, still holding Raiden aloft, looks back at the entrance.

Raiden:
        S...snake?

Behind Fortune is Snake, tightly bound.

Solidus:
        Bring him in.

Solidus injects Phenolbarbital B (‘truth serum’) into Raiden’s neck with on of
his tentacles. Injection sound.

Raiden loses consciousness.

First-person demo, Arsenal head section. Arsenal has already ascended to the
surface. The sun has gone down, and there is very little to see this far away
from Manhattan. The steady rain also serves to obscure the view. The bad
weather and the isolated location suggests that there is very little
possibility of armed intervention from concerned outside parties. First-person
demo, camera panning only. The player can move the camera view up, down, left,
and right in order to take in their situation. There are drops of water on the
first-person-view camera lens.

Blurred vision. Push the up, down, right and left keys to shake off the

Solidus ahead, manned (prototype) RAY right in front. At RAY’s foot is Ocelot.
Fortune and Snake(cuffed) to the left. Snake is still out cold. Solidus has
his back to Raiden as he talks. RAY is floating on the surface of the sea.
Fine, misty rain  use the Tanker Chapter effects. Raindrops slide down the
first-person view. Raiden has been injected with Phenolbarbital B and is in a
hazy, drugged state. Screen effect (Shibata).

Solidus:
        GW, the Arsenal AI, is corrupted beyond repair. I admit that I
        underestimated you...

Solidus spins around, and lashing out with a tentacle, lifts Raiden off the
ground by the throat. Raise camera height. The pile of chains on the floor
are pulled taut (SE only).

Solidus:

The O2 gauge appears onscreen. The O2 level begins to drop, and unless the

Arsenal has ascended to the surface. Do not yet show the entirety of the unit.
Raiden and the others are on the brow of the tortoise. It is too far from
Manhattan to see anything. Solidus finally frees Raiden and the latter gulps
in lungfuls of air, coughing and wheezing. Fortune faces Solidus. Solidus
retracts his tentacle, leaving Raiden to crash to the ground.

Raiden:
        (sharp grunt)
Fortune:
        What do you mean?
Solidus:
        That’s not your business.
Fortune:
        Oh really? It so happens I have some business of my own to attend to.

Fortune turns to leave.

Solidus:
        Planning to hijack Arsenal?

Fortune, her intent exposed, stops dead in her tracks.

Fortune:
        !
Solidus:
        You were going to screw me over, weren’t you?
Fortune:
        ...Who talked. Ocelot?
Solidus:
        Not exactly. I was the one who used Ocelot to suggest the idea to you
        in the first place.
Fortune:
        What?
Solidus:
        I was planning to give you Arsenal to being with.
Fortune:
        ...Why the uncharacteristic generosity?
Solidus:
        I’m no philanthropist.

Long shot to give some indication of Arsenals size, though the full scale is
still concealed.

Solidus:
        Arsenal is far from impregnable. It needs other Metal Gears as guards,
        a huge payload of warheads, and full air, sea and land support to
        function efficiently. Against a large attack force, without support,
        Arsenal is nothing more than a gigantic coffin.
Solidus:
        Seizing Arsenal was never the real objective.
Fortune:
        (silently furious) What was your objective, then?
Solidus:
        A list of names - of the Patriots!

        Arsenal since you don’t care for it anyway; the purified hydrogen bomb
        is ready to go.
Solidus:
        A nuclear strike won’t stop them.
Fortune:
        It will damage their power source - the mindless masses that they
        control. First things first.

Ocelot:
        Charades usually are humorous. I wouldn’t have minded watching some
        more of it, but we’re running short on time...
Solidus:
        What are you talking about.
Ocelot:
        Everything you’ve done here has been scripted  a little exercise set
        up by us.
Solidus:
        Exercise?
Ocelot:
        The S3 plan was conceived as a means to produce soldiers on par with
        Solid Snake. That’s what I told you. But the VR training the boy was
        put through is not the meat of the program.
Ocelot:
        You think this little terrorist incident is your own doing, Solidus?
        THIS is the S3 training kernel  an orchestrated recreation of Shadow

Ocelot:
        Ames’ own nanomachines were used to shut down his pacemaker.
Ocelot:
        I arranged for the appearance of the Ninja as well.
Ocelot:
        As for the President - although Johnson realized what was going on,
        he played out his allotted part.
Ocelot:
        As for the computer virus, it’s a digital counterpart of FOXDIE. It
        was also designed to eliminate every scrap of information regarding
        the Patriots from GW. Your plan was invalidated even before execution,
        Solidus.
Ocelot:
        Fatman was a different story. He’s one of our own people, a sort of
        examiner we hired to test the boy’s(Raiden) progress before letting
        him handle the exercise proper. We had to arrange for Stillman’s
        presence to coax the maniac into agreeing. If the boy had allowed the
        Big Shell to be destroyed, this exercise would have ended there. This
        project has no room for failures.

Ocelot:
        Fortune, you and the rest of Dead Cell stand in for the FOXHOUND squad
        that Snake took on in Shadow Moses. You’re the most impressive
        collection of freaks outside of  FOXHOUND. We’ve gone to a lot of
        trouble to set you up against the boy. That story about purified
        hydrogen bombs is just the tip of the iceberg.
Ocelot:
        The project was already underway when I sunk that tanker along with
        your old man two years ago. Throwing your husband in the brig was a
        part of it too.
Ocelot:
        You were told that the eradication of Dead Cell six months ago was an
        act of the Patriots. We provoked and encouraged your hatred - and you
        opted for vengeance, just as we planned.
Fortune:

Ocelot:
        Except for the appearance of the real Solid Snake. I wonder now, who
        sent for you...?

Ocelot:

He flings down the P90 and draws his swords. (Solidus uses two blades) the
steel collar snaps shut, RAY starts to fire its machine gun, and Solidus
deflects the bullets with both swords.

away from Fortune, then harmlessly detonate in midair.

The RAY remains submerged, somewhere under the foaming surface. Arsenal starts
to move, and the violent undulations leave Raiden and Solidus flat on the

Arsenal races northward.

Arsenal Gear tears past the NYSE and comes to a halt face to face with the
Federal Hall. The impact sends Raiden and Solidus flying off Arsenal and onto
the roof of the Federal Hall. Cut to aerial view to reveal the full scale of
Arsenal for the first time (this is the first full-on vie of Arsenal). Right
in front of Arsenal’s head section are the Federal Hall and the statue of
Washington. Insert cuts of New York landmarks/tourist spots.

There are very few people stirring in the pre-dawn streets. The screams and
the sirens have yet to start up. The pigeons (or gulls?) that roost in the
Federal Hall are reeling. There is smoke everywhere (foggy effect) from the
collision impact.

Solidus struggles to his feet on the Federal Hall roof and looks around.

Solidus:
        Federal Hall...

Solidus starts to laugh.

Solidus:
        (Laugh)

Throwing up both hands, he breaks into a frenzied dance. Raiden snaps out of
shock at the sound of Solidus’ voice.

Raiden:
        What are you laughing at?

Solidus stops dancing.

Solidus:
        Do you know what day it is today?
Raiden:
        ...April 30th?

Solidus:
        That’s right. George Washington took office as the first President of
        the United States of America 200 ***note: this should say 223*** years
        ago today.

The American Flag on Federal Hall is flapping in the breeze.

Solidus:
        And it happened right here.

George Washington’s inauguration took place on the second-floor balcony of the
Federal Hall. The original building was destroyed in 1812, then rebuilt in
1842.

Solidus:
        We were going to declare another independence - the dawn of a new
        nation - here.
Solidus:
        The end of the Patriots secret rule, liberation of this country 
        this was where it was supposed to being, this is where freedom could
        have been born.

Raiden:
        All you want is power -- at any cost.

Solidus pauses to consider Raiden’s statement.

Solidus:
        Jack, its’ not power I want.
Solidus:
        What I wanted to take back from the Patriots were things like --
Solidus:
        -- freedom, civil rights, opportunities. The founding principles of
        this country.
Solidus:
        Everything that’s about to be wiped out by their digital censorship.

Solidus begins an impassioned speech right there on the roof of the Federal
Hall.

Solidus:
        Jack, listen to me.

He is talking, not to Raiden but himself.

Solidus:
        We’re all born with an expiration date.
Solidus:
        No one lasts forever.
Solidus:
        Life is nothing but a grace period --
Solidus:

        The data of life is transferred from parent to child.
Solidus:
        That’s how it works.
Solidus:
        But we have no heirs, no legacy.
Solidus:
        They call my brothers and me ‘Les Enfants Terribles’ - cloned from
        our father with the ability to reproduce conveniently engineered out.
Solidus:
        What is our legacy if we cannot pass on the torch?
Solidus:
        Proof of our existence -- a mark of some sort --
Solidus:
        -- other than simple DNA, just like parent to child...
Solidus:
        It extends beyond DNA, information is imparted as well (knowledge,

Solidus:

Solidus:
        The Patriots are trying to protect their power, their own interests by
        controlling the digital flow of information.
Solidus:
        I want my memory, my existence to remain.
Solidus:
        Unlike an intron of History.
Solidus:
        I will be remembered as an exon.
Solidus:
        That will be my legacy, my mark in history.
Solidus:
        But the patriots would deny me even that.
Solidus:
        I will triumph over the Patriots and liberate us all.
Solidus:
        And we will be the ‘Sons of Liberty’.

In Solidus’ mind, the bells of Liberty ring out. The tolling bridges into the
CALL sound. CALL from the Colonel.

Colonel:

Colonel:
        Under the protection of the flag...

The Star-Spangled Banner starts up.

Colonel:
        We (The Patriots) are formless...
Colonel:
        We are the very discipline and morality that Americans invoke so
        often.
Colonel:
        How can anyone hope to eliminate us?
Colonel:
        As long as this nation exists, so will we.
Raiden:
        Cut the crap! If you’re so immortal, why would you take away
        individual freedoms and censor the Net?
Rose:
        (Laugh) Jack, don’t be silly.
Colonel:
        Don’t you know that our plans have your interests - not ours - in
        mind?
Raiden:
        What?
Rose:
         Jack, listen carefully like a good boy!
Colonel:
        The mapping of the human genome was completed early this century. As
        a result, the evolutionary log of the human race lay open to us.
Rose:
        We started with genetic engineering, and in the end, we succeeded in
        digitizing life itself.
Colonel:
        But there are things not covered by genetic information.
Raiden:
        What do you mean?
Colonel:
        Human memories, ideas. Culture. History.
Rose:
        Genes don’t contain any record of human history.
Colonel:
        Is it something that should not be passed on? Should that information
        be left at the mercy of nature?
Rose:
        We’ve always kept records of our lives. Through words, pictures,
        symbols... from tablets to books --
Colonel:
        But not all the information was inherited by later generations. A
        small percentage of the whole was selected and processed, then passed
        on. Not unlike genes, really.
Rose:
        That’s what history is, Jack.
Colonel:
        But in the current, digitized world, trivial information is
        accumulating every second, preserved in all its triteness.
Colonel:
        Never fading, always accessible.
Rose:
        Rumors about petty issues, misinterpretations, slander...
Colonel:
        All this junk data preserved in an unfiltered state, growing at an
        alarming rate.
Rose:
        It will only slow down social progress, reduce the rate of evolution.
Colonel:
        Raiden, you seem to think our plan is one of censorship.
Raiden:
        Are you telling me its not!?
Rose:
        You’re being silly! What we propose to do is not to control content,
        but to create context.
Raiden:
        Create context?
Colonel:
        The digital society furthers human flaws and selectively rewards
        development of convenient half-truths.
Colonel:
        Just look at the strange juxtapositions of morality around you.
Rose:
        Billions spent on new weapons in order to humanly murder other
        humans.
Colonel:
        Rights of criminals are given more respect than those of their
        victims.
Rose:
        Although there are people suffering in poverty, huge donations are
        made to protect endangered species.
Rose:
        Everyone grows up being told the same thing.
Colonel:
        Be nice to other people.
Rose:
        But beat out the competition!
Colonel:
        ‘You’re special.’ ‘Believe in yourself and you will succeed.’
Rose:
        But it’s obvious from the start that only a few can succeed...
Colonel:
        You exercise your right to ‘freedom’ and this is the result.
Colonel:
        All a rhetoric to avoid conflict and protect each other from hurt.
        The untested truths spun by different interests continue to churn and
        accumulate in the sandbox of political correctness and valve systems.
Rose:
        Everyone withdraws into their own small gated community, afraid of a
        larger forum. They stay inside their little ponds, leaking whatever
        ‘truth’ suits them into the growing cesspool of society at large.
Colonel:
        The different cardinal truths neither clash nor mesh. No one is
        invalidated, but nobody is right.
Rose:
        Not even natural selection can take place here. The world is being
        engulfed in ‘truth’.
Colonel:
        ‘And this is how the world ends. Not with a bang, but a whimper.’
Rose:
        We’re trying to stop that from happening.
Colonel:
        It’s our responsibility as rulers.
Colonel:
        Just as in genetics, unnecessary information and memory must be
        filtered out to stimulate the evolution of the species.
Raiden:
        And you think you’re qualified to decide what’s necessary and what’s
        not?
Colonel:
        Absolutely. Who else could wade through the sea of garbage you people
        produce, retrieve valuable truths and even interpret their meaning
        for later generations?
Rose:
        That’s what it means to create context.
Raiden:
        I’ll decide for myself what to believe and what to pass on!
Colonel:
        But is that even your own idea?
Rose:
        Or something Snake told you?
Raiden:
        ...(Touche)
Colonel:
        That’s the proof of your incompetence, right there. You lack the
        qualifications to exercise free will.
Raiden:
        (lashing out) That’s not true! I have the right --
Rose:
        (image splits/Rose enters) Does something like a ‘self’ exist inside
        of you?
Colonel:
        That which you call ‘self’ serves as nothing more than a mask to
        cover your own being.
Rose:
        In this era of ready made ‘truths’, ‘self’ is just something used to
        preserve those positive emotions that you occasionally feel...
Colonel:
        ...another possibility is that ‘self’ is a concept you borrowed under
        the logic that it would endow you with some sense of strength...
Raiden:
        That’s crap!
Colonel:
        Is it? Would you prefer that someone else tell you? Alright then.
        Explain it to him.
Rose:
        (feigning sincerity) Jack, you’re simply the best! And you got there
        all by yourself! (emphasize self)
Raiden:
        Rrrr... (ridiculing me like this)
Colonel:
        Oh, what happened? Do you feel lost? Why not try a bit of soul-
        searching?
Rose:
        Don’t think you’ll find anything, though...
Colonel:
        Ironic that although ‘self’ is something you yourself fashioned,
        every time something goes wrong, you turn around and place the blame
        on something else.
Rose:
        (imitating Raiden) It’s not my fault. It’s not your fault.
Colonel:
        In denial, you simply resort to looking for another, more convenient
        ‘truth’ in order to make yourself feel better.
Rose:
        ...leaving behind in an instant the so-called ‘truth’ you once
        embraced.
Colonel:
        Should someone like that be allowed to decide what is ‘truth’?
Rose:
        Should someone like you even have the right to decide?
Colonel:
        You’ve done nothing but abuse your freedom.
Rose:
        You don’t deserve to be free!
Colonel:
        We’re not the ones smothering the world. You are.
Rose:
        The individual is supposed to be weak. But far from powerless - a
        single person has the potential to ruin the world.
Colonel:
        And the age of digitized communication has given even more power to
        the individual. Too much power for such an immature species. That’s
        why we’ve decided to be your guardians, if you will.
Rose:
        Building a legacy involves figuring out what is wanted, and what
        needs to be done for that goal. All this, you used to struggle with.
        Now, we think for you.
Colonel:
        We are your guardians after all.
Raiden:
        You want to control human thought? Human behavior?
Colonel:
        Of course. Anything can be quantified nowadays. That’s what this
        exercise was designed to prove.
Rose:
        You fell in love with me just as you were meant to, after all. Isn’t
        that right, Jack?
Colonel:
        Ocelot was not told the whole truth, to say the least.
Rose:
        We rule an entire nation - of what interest would a single soldier,
        no matter how able, be to us?
Colonel:
        The S3 plan does not stand for Solid Snake Simulation.
Colonel:
        What is does stand for is Selection for Societal Sanity...

Rose:

Colonel:

        circumstances. It was an optimal test for S3’s crisis management
        capacity. If the model could trigger, control and solve this, it

Colonel:
        Raiden, there are also reasons behind your selection. Solidus raised
        plenty of other child soldiers. Do you know why we chose you over
        them?
Raiden:
        ?
Colonel:
        It was because you were the only one who refused to acknowledge the
        past. All the others remember what they were, and pay for it daily.
Rose:
        But you turn your back on everything you don’t like. You do whatever
        you like, see only the things you like, and for yourself alone.
Colonel:
        Yes - Rose can attest to that.
Rose:
        You refused to see me for what I was. I lied to you, but I wanted to
        be caught. You pretended to be understanding, to be a gentleman...
        you never made a conscious attempt to reach out to me... the only
        time you did was when I gave you no choice but to do so...
Raiden:
        (responds to these accurate accusations without thinking, despite
        knowing he was lied to) I was just trying no to...
Rose:
        (image splits/Rose enters) What? ‘Trying not to hurt me?’ Dear, the
        one you were trying not to hurt was yourself! Avoiding the truth
        under the guise of ‘kindness’ is all that you did!
Rose:
        It occurred to you to do nothing but look out for yourself. Even if
        you claim it was for my sake, that feeling was nowhere to be seen. In
        the end, everything was for your sake. ...I was never part of the
        picture.
Colonel:
        (sneering) Ha, ha, ha ...exactly right.
Colonel:
        So you see, you’re a perfect representative of the masses we need to
        protect. This is why we chose you.
Colonel:
        You accepted the fiction we’ve provided, obeyed our orders and did
        everything you were told to. The exercise is a resounding success.
Colonel(Emma):
        Didn’t I tell you that GW was still incomplete? But not anymore,
        thanks to you.
Colonel:
        Your persona, experiences, triumphs and defeats are nothing but by-
        products. The real objective was ensuring that we could generate and
        manipulate them. It’s taken a lot of time and money, but it was well
        worth it considering the results.
Raiden:

of Washington, standing askew. Raiden looks on, spent. He believes that by
killing Solidus, he has severed the link with his past. However, he feels no
sense of resolution.

Raiden:
        Who am I really... (echoes of Solidus’ confession)

Snake cuts in. he has appeared at Raiden’s side unnoticed.

Snake:
        No one quite knows who or what they are.

He lays a hand on Raiden’s shoulder.

Snake:
        The memories you have and the role you were assigned are burdens you
        had to carry.
Snake:
        It doesn’t matter if they were real or not.

Movie

Slow-motion footage. Everyday shots of various Manhattan landmarks excluding
the Federal Hall. Daytime live-action shots would work.

Snake:
        There’s no such thing in the world as absolute reality.
Snake:
        Most of what they call real is actually fiction.
Snake:
        What you think you see is only as real as your brain tells you it
        is.
Raiden:
        Then what am I supposed to believe in? What am I going to leave
        behind when I’m through?
Snake:
        We can tell other people about - having faith. What we had faith
        in.
Snake:
        What we found important enough to fight for.
Snake:
        It’s not whether you were right or wrong, but how much faith you
        were willing to have, that decides the future.
Snake:
        The Patriots are a kind of ongoing fiction too, come to think of
        it...
Raiden:
        ...
Snake:
        Listen, don’t obsess over words so much. Find the meaning behind the
        words, then decide.
Snake:
        You can find your own name.
Snake:
        And your own future...
Raiden:
        Decide for myself...?
Snake:
        And whatever you choose will be you.
Raiden:
        I don’t know if I can...
Snake:
        I know you didn’t have much in terms of choices this time. An
        allusion to the fact that this game did not have a choice driven
        narrative.
Snake:
        But everything you felt, thought about during the mission is yours.
        And what you decided to do with them is your choice...
Raiden:
        Like how I’m going to start my life over? (Raiden:   You mean start
        over?)
Snake:
        Yeah, a clean slate. A new name, new memories.
Raiden:
        ...
Snake:
        Choose your own legacy. It’s for you to decide.
Snake:
        It’s up to you.

In front of Federal Hall

Snake notices the ID tags around Raiden’s neck.

Snake:
        By the way, what is that?

Raiden takes the dog tags off.

Raiden:
        Dog tags?

Raiden looks at the tags. They are marked with the name (max 12 letters),
age, gender, and blood type that the user entered at the beginning of the
game. Raiden looks to Snake for affirmation, but the latter, a smile on his
face, shakes his head. Raiden looks at the tags once again.

Snake:
        Anyone you know?

Raiden closes his hand around the tags.

Raiden:
        No, never heard the name before.
Raiden:
        I’ll pick my own name --
Raiden:
        -- and my own life. I’ll find something worth passing on.

He tosses the dog tags far away over the crowd. Snake smiles and nods.
Raiden nods back, looking slightly abashed.
Snake looks at Solidus’ body.

Raiden:
        They taught me some good things too.
Snake:
        I know. We’ve inherited freedom from all those who’ve fought for it.
Snake:
        We all have the freedom to spread the word. Even me.

Raiden suddenly remembers something.

Raiden:
        Snake, what about Olga’s child?
Snake:
        Don’t worry. I’ll find him. Count on it.
Snake:
        As long as you keep yourself alive, he’s safe.
Raiden:
        Do you know where Liquid went?
Snake:
        I put a transmitter on his RAY.
Raiden:
        Did he head for the Patriots?
Snake:
        Yeah. But I have a feeling they gave Ocelot a bogus location to
        begin with.
Raiden:
        ...
Snake:
        Cheer up. We have a better lead.
Snake:
        This contains the list of all the Patriots.

Snake takes out an MO disc.

Raiden:
        But Ocelot took it!

Raiden reaches for the MO disc.

Snake:
        The one we gave you wasn’t the real thing.

Snake withdraws the disc, messing with Raiden.

Raiden:
        What?

Somewhat sulkily.

Snake:
        The virus is coded to destroy only a specific part of GW  namely
        the information about the Patriots’ identities.

Close up of the disc.

Snake:
        Which means that there’s a parameter coded in here that defines what
        that information is.
Raiden:
        I get it - analyze the code and you can probably find out where
        they operate.
Raiden:
        Count me in --
Snake:
        No, things you have to do first.
Snake:
        And people you need to talk to...
Raiden:
        ? (noticing something)

Rose stands alone, her back to the crowd. She sees Raiden and waves her
right hand.

Raiden:
        ?

Raiden realizes that Rose really does exist. They face each other in the
middle of the street. Roses hair is now blonde.

Raiden, remembering Snake, looks around for him.

Raiden:
        Snake?

Snake has already vanished. Otacon is not in sight, but Emma’s parrot can be
seen taking off.

(Snake and Otacon have already departed in Otacon’s car.)

Rose:
        What’s wrong?
Raiden:
        Nothing...
Raiden:
        Can I ask you something? Who am I really?

Raiden is serious. Rose is smiling.

Rose:
        I wouldn’t know.
Raiden:
        ...

Raiden grows perturbed.

Rose:
        But we’re going to find out together, aren’t we?
Raiden:
        Oh... yeah...

He cups Roses face between his palms as if to reassure himself of her
existence.

Rose:
        See me for what I am, okay?
Raiden:
        I know.

Rose caresses her stomach and lowers her gaze for a while.

Rose:
        Do you remember this place?
Raiden:
        Of course. This is where we first met.
Raiden:
        I remember now --
Rose:
        Hm?
Raiden:
        Today is the day I met you.
Rose:
        That’s it.
Raiden:
        I think I found something to pass along to the future.
Rose:
        ...What?
Raiden:
        He said all living things want their genes to live on.
Rose:
        Are you talking about the baby?

Same as Snake’s dialogue in the previous title.

Raiden:
        Yeah. But genes aren’t the only thing you pass on.
Raiden:
        There are too many things that aren’t written in our DNA.
Raiden:
        It’s up to us to teach that to our children.
Rose:
        What kinds of things?
Raiden:
        About the environment, our ideas, our culture... poetry...
        compassion... sorrow... joy...
Raiden:

Black background. Audio only TV newscast. Visual of the Statue of Liberty
stranded on Ellis Island, carried there by Arsenal Gear from its perch on
Liberty Island. The statue is in front of the immigration Museum. The
voiceover fades in and out erratically.

Karen:
        This is Karen Hojo, reporting from Ellis Island. The effect of last
        night’s incident are apparent, even here. The Statue of Liberty made
        the long trip from France to Liberty Island in 1886 as a birthday
        present if you will of our independence. She now stands in front of
        the Immigration Museum.
Karen:
        At long last, it seems that she will go through the immigration
        process.

The statue is in front of the Immigration Museum on Ellis island. The humor
here is that it has taken Liberty more than a century after its arrival in
the U.S. in 1886 to get to Immigrations. The final question should also
serve as a query to the users on whether they are fit to make decisions on
their own.

Snake:
        Life isn’t just about passing on your genes. We can leave behind
        much more than just DNA. Through speech, music, literature and
        movies... what we’ve seen, heard, felt  anger, joy and sorrow 
        these are the things I will pass on. That’s what I live for.
Snake:
        We need to pass the torch, and let our children red our messy and
        sad history by its light.
Snake:
        We have the magic of the digital age to do that with.
Snake:
        The human race will probably come to an end some time, and new
        species may rule over this planet. Earth may not be forever, but we
        still have the responsibility to leave what trace of life we can.
        Building the future and keeping the past alive are one in the same
        thing.
